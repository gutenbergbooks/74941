<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter1">To be looked upon as a favored
“member” of Aunt Susan Smiley’s cook shop,
all the requisites one need have were the ability to
appreciate her gumbo and sweet potato pies,
coupled with a talent for telling a good story.</p>

</div>

<p>The gumbo and pies were not only a pride to Aunt
Susan, but were things of great marvel to the whole
colored population the full length of the river
“coast.” Of course the pies were best when yams
were in season. But with a little “sweet milk” and a
dash of vanilla extract, she was able to work wonders
with the commoner variety of sweet potato,
and few of her patrons knew the difference; unless
they had some knowledge of truck gardening and
were “well-posted ’bout potato-time.”</p>

<p>Like all good cooks, Aunt Susan was careful not
to reveal to her dusky sisters the secret of her
original recipes. And if any white person asked her
to tell how she prepared some of her dainty concoctions,
she never went beyond saying: “Honey, de
firs’ thing you gotta have is a black han’.”</p>

<p>The telling of stories was a thing Aunt Susan
looked to with the discrimination of a true judge
of oral literature. Her patrons were free to pass
the whole night in her shop, sitting before the cheerful
fire on the hearth, provided they had a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
story to tell or a good song to sing, whatever the
model might be; it being understood that pies and
gumbo were available for the growing appetite,
and drip coffee could be furnished when needed to
soothe the husky throats of the indefatigable singers.
If the season happened to be summer, bountiful
pitchers of lemonade with raspberry syrup took
the place of black coffee; and every one could “lap
up limonade an’ spread joy to a comfut.”</p>

<p>Alcoholic drinks were taboo. Not because Aunt
Susan had any religious scruples; for she frankly
admitted she was “no licentage Chrishtun;” but because
she felt that “a nigger in licker ain’ no fittin’
comp’ny for nobody decen’, Chrishtun or w’atsomeever.”</p>

<p>It mattered little if a “member” hadn’t any money.
If he could tell an interesting story, his credit was
good until the end of the week, at which time he
was expected to pay. Failing in this, he was declared
“on-finanshul,” and was denied the privilege
of the house until he reinstated himself.</p>

<p>A black space on the side wall carried the various
accounts marked up in chalk; a stroke for each pie
or plate of gumbo, in one column; and a like marking
for the drinks in another column. As each mark
stood for a nickel, it was an easy matter to reckon
when the time came for settling up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>Although unable to read, Aunt Susan’s manner of
counting and making change had the accuracy of
a primitive Chinese abacus-Pythagoricus. On the
mantelshelf she kept a blue bowl half-filled with
grains of corn. If a dollar bill were given in settlement
of an account, grains of corn equalling the
amount of the bill were counted out on the table.
Then the strokes on the wall were counted, and as
many grains of corn were taken from the whole;
the remaining grains representing the change to
be returned. Fortunately, the patrons seldom presented
her with anything higher than a two dollar
bill. However slow the process, the method was
sure; and even though she had to change a five
dollar note now and then, no one ever complained
of wrong count.</p>

<p>Aunt Susan was a kindly, soft-voiced, full-bosomed
woman, about sixty years old. She had
no family of her own; but living with her, as a sort
of charge, was a blind man named Tom Lakes,
some twenty years her junior. She had known Tom
from his early childhood, and had always taken a
motherly interest in him; mending his clothes, cooking
his meals, and taking care of his money for
him, long before he married and met with the horrible
accident which caused his blindness.</p>

<p>Tom married a young woman who came to the village<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
a stranger,—“some wile Georgia nigger out
de wilderness,” as she was called by Tom’s friends,
few of whom had any regard for her because of
her arrogance and “scawnful ways.”</p>

<p>After his marriage, Tom continued to pay his
daily visits to Aunt Susan; helping her peel potatoes,
clean crabs for the gumbo, chop wood, and
redden the floor with brick-dust; just as he had always
done. These little attentions awakened a feeling
of resentment in the suspicious mind of the
scornful Georgia lady. Tom was kind to her and
provided for every humble need; but why must
he go and do work for another woman?... And
his visits at night; going to take part in the singing
and story-telling with other people before Susan’s
fireplace;—another thorn in her jealous
soul. Every invitation from Tom to go along with
him, she refused; preferring to remain at home,
brooding and wondering. She was sure something
more than “ole lady” interest held Tom to Aunt
Susan. No woman kept a man’s money unless
there was something secret between them,—and the
man with a “natchal wife of his own”.... “Who?
Do I look like I got any green in my eye, keep me
from seein’ w’at direction de win’ blowin’ in?—Tom
mus’ be take me for a fool!”</p>

<p>So she mused to herself when he was away by day;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
brooding deeper on the seeming deception when he
was away at night revelling in the pleasant flow
of song and story and the wholesome regalement
of crab gumbo and sweet potato pie.</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter2">The night of July 4th was
to be a “big interprise” at Aunt Susan’s. Three
“good altone songsters” were coming to lend added
luster to the meeting, and make the “buildin’ rock
wid ole-time shoutin’ praise.” Aunt Susan was
over the stove the greater part of the day, making
pies; and to give the gumbo an extra flavor, Tom
had gone crawfishing and brought home a basket
full of crawfish, which he would give as his donation.
Bell told him she would boil them and pick them,
a wifely condescension which pleased Tom as much
as it caused him to wonder.</p>

</div>

<p>“Maybe her min’ done change at las’. An’ maybe
she’ll go ’long wid me tonight to Sis’ Susan house,”
thought Tom, as he dragged a chair out on the
front gallery and sat down in the shade of the
honeysuckle vines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“Bell alright; ’cep’ for her nasty, jealous-hearted
ways,” he argued to himself.</p>

<p>The afternoon was hot and still. A quivering, dancing
heat was visible in the brilliant sunlight. Not a
leaf stirred on the chinaberry trees by the front
fence. A few dejected chickens hid under the castor
oil bush by the step, their wings drooping, their
mouths open, panting like jaded runners after a
weary race.</p>

<p>Bell was inside, looking after the pot of crawfish
boiling on the charcoal furnace. The swampy smell
of the crawfish mingled with the odor of red pepper,
floated through the house and over the gallery,
where Tom was already in a deep slumber.</p>

<p>Bell came out to the front door and looked at him,
then went back to the kitchen. She sat down, gazing
at the pot on the furnace, a strange expression
creeping over her face. For a long time she sat
like one in a profound study. Her eyes contracted,
and she began to gnaw her thumb nail abstractedly,
a mask-like vacancy covering her face with dark
inscrutability. Passing her hand across her face
slowly, she got up and looked at the boiling crawfish.
They were bright scarlet; they were done.
Taking a colander from the wall, she put it in the
dishpan on the table; then, lifting the pot from the
fire, she emptied the seething mass into the colander,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
shaking it well until all the water was out,
then put it on the window-sill to cool. Passing her
hand across her mouth in a cryptic manner, she
went again to the front door and looked at Tom
furtively. He was sleeping soundly. She went back
to the kitchen, and taking the dishpan of hot water
from the table, walked out to the front gallery.</p>

<p>Tom was asleep. A deep, manly, snoring sleep
held him fast.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’ know.... It’s so easy to trip,—to
stumble. For de handle to slip out my han’”....
The thoughts went chasing through her mind, as
she stood over him with the steam rising from the
crawfish water like an ominous mist.</p>

<p>“Dey say linseed oil good for scaldin’.... Tom
got some in a bottle yonder in de woodshed....
I know how to look aft’ him. Den he <i>gotta</i> stay
’way from Susan”....</p>

<p>An unearthly yell started the quivering air....
The dishpan fell to the floor with a jangling crash.
“Have mercy! Lawd, have mercy!” Tom’s reiterated
cry sounded across the yard with pathetic
appeal, the scalding water tinctured with red pepper
torturing him viciously.</p>

<p>No one saw the savage deed but the frightened
chickens hiding under the castor oil bush, and Bell
swore that it was an accident. She was arrested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and sent to jail, but Tom maintained that she was
innocent; believing Bell’s flimsy story that she had
stumbled against his foot.</p>

<p>“Who? Tom ain’ nothin’ but a plumb fool,” commented
Seelan, as she left the house after her visit
of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Ain’ Tom know it never was Bell practice habit to
th’ow trash water in de front yard?... Comin’
clean th’oo de house to de front do’ to empty a dishpan
o’ scaldin’ water? Shucks! Tom des natchally
childish.”</p>

<p>“You sho is right,” agreed Felo. “I ain’ never like
Bell from de firs’ beginnin’. I ain’ trus’ <i>no</i> ooman
w’at got side-b’yeards growin’ ’long-side her jaws
like Bell got. Da’s a <i>bad</i> sign.”</p>

<p>And so the comment continued for weeks among
Tom’s friends wherever they met.</p>

<p>After the bandage was removed from Tom’s eyes,
the doctor told him that he was hopelessly blind.
His face took on a look of sudden despair, and in a
pleading tone, he said:</p>

<p>“Please suh, doctor, don’ joke me in my mis’ry.”</p>

<p>No one spoke. After a few seconds, Susan took
hold of his hand, her affectionate grasp, more eloquent
than any spoken word, revealing to him the
awful truth of the doctor’s statement.</p>

<p>“Sweet man, Jesus,” he exclaimed, raising his head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
imploringly; “please tell me w’at po’ Tom goin’
do!”</p>

<p>“You goin’ go home wid Susan, an’ set in yo’ chair
yonder ’fo de fire,” came the soft-toned, comforting
reply. “An’ Susan goin’ look aft’ you des like
she did befo’.”</p>

<p>Then leading him by the hand, they left the doctor’s
office and started up the coast towards home.</p>

<p>Bell was tried before a jury, but as there was no
available witness to give testimony in the case, she
was acquitted as innocent and ordered by the court
to go back to Georgia. “Back to de wilderness,
whah she b’lonks.” As Tom’s friends declared, with
picturesque indignation.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter3">The 4th of July meeting
having been postponed on account of Tom’s accident,
it was scheduled to take place on All Saints’
Day, he being sufficiently recovered to participate
in the “interprise.”</p>

</div>

<p>In honor of his coming to live with Susan, the old
house was “treated to a fine fixin’-up.” The clapboard
front was given a coat of pink-wash, and the
horseshoe over the door painted a vivid green. New
turkey red curtains were hung on all the windows;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
a new white marbled oilcloth was bought for the
long guest table in the middle of the room; fresh
shelf coverings of newspaper cut in fantastic scallops
were put in the safe and on the pot shelf
against the wall; and the hearth bricks and
chimney-piece were treated to a new coat of red
ochre. The floor was scrubbed and sprinkled with
brick dust; the cypress benches, scrubbed and
rubbed until the water-waves of the grain took on
the appearance of old satin. And Tom’s chair beside
the hearth was given a comfortable cushion covered
with a piece of old plaid shawl. The mantelshelf
was hung with garlands of garlic and bay
leaf, long strings of red pepper pods, and bunches
of onions. Two brightly-polished tomato cans, supporting
cocoanuts, filled the place of ornaments at
each end of the mantelpiece; and in the center stood
a venerable steeple-top clock, telling that it was
near the time for the “members” to arrive. A glowing
fire of magnolia burrs and driftwood burned
on the hearth; and the place had an impressive air
of humble, medieval cheer.</p>

<p>Aunt Susan came in from the next room, followed
by Tom carrying an armful of driftwood. She
helped him put it on the pile in the chimney-corner,
then led him to his chair, handing him a corncob
pipe, which she lighted with an ember from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
ashes. He began smoking, and Susan busied herself
fixing the pies in the safe, and raking the coals
of fire about the large iron pot of gumbo on the
hearth. She had the air of the true mistress of the
inn. The careful precision with which her green-and-yellow
head-handkerchief was tied, and the
dignity with which she wore her stiff-starched gingham
apron, might be looked upon as badges of innate
cleanliness and gentility.</p>

<p>Another entertaining detail was her cascade of bosoms
in their snug-fitting sacque of gray woolen,
making one think of those large, healthy, double-breasted
Dutch women Rembrandt loved to paint
with such startling fidelity.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter4">“Susan,” Tom called to
her softly, “befo’ anybody git hyuh, I wan’ ax you
somh’n.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Yas, Tom, I’m list’nin’,” she answered.</p>

<p>He took a long pull at his pipe, blew the smoke
out slowly, then said:</p>

<p>“If any de members hyuh tonight raise de queshton
concernin’ Bell, you ain’ goin’ leave ’um specify,
is you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Walking over to his chair, Susan put her hand on
his shoulder, and said quietly:</p>

<p>“Is you ever known me to tamper wid de devil aft’
I done beat ’im out my track?”</p>

<p>“You right, Susan. Da’s sufficien’,” he answered,
and went on with his peaceful smoking.</p>

<p>The first member to arrive was Scilla, a tall, buxom,
good-natured young woman with a snub nose and
surprised-looking eyes. Her dress was a guinea
blue, of plain make, the “josey” very close-fitting.
Her head was bare; and her only ornamentation,
a pair of large, flat, pearl earrings, which seemed
to heighten the bizarre expression of her humorous
face and the velvety sheen of her ebon complexion.</p>

<p>She came bursting into the room suddenly, calling
out in mock-excitement:</p>

<p>“But no, Sis’ Susan! W’at you an’ Mr. Tom doin’,
settin’ hyuh in de dark together like ole folks?
Nobody ain’ come yet? Dis de right night, ain’
it?”</p>

<p>“For Gawd sake, Scilla, don’ be so boist’us,” Susan
replied, getting up to light the lamps on the table,
and quietly putting them in their places.</p>

<p>“O ’scuse me, Sis’ Susan; I didn’ know y’all was
holin’ a wake,” returned Scilla playfully.</p>

<p>“Gal, set down an’ be still like people,” said Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
“You ain’ bin hyuh for a week, an’ you mus’ be got
some news to tell, ’side yo’ random talk. Susan,
bring de gal a cup o’ coffee an’ leave her git to
business.”</p>

<p>“Da’s right, Mr. Tom. I wan’ make you laugh
’bout my w’ite folks,” Scilla answered.</p>

<p>Susan brought her a cup of coffee, and took a seat
on the opposite side of the table. Scilla helped herself
generously to sugar, and as she stirred her coffee,
began her gossip.</p>

<p>“You ain’ goin’ b’lieve me w’en I tell you I ain’
workin’ for Miss Mimi no longer.” (Looks of astonishment
from Tom and Susan.) “I des <i>had</i> to
leave. You know, dey say niggers ain’ got no principle.
But dey got a whole lot o’ w’ite folks w’at
ain’ a bit better.”</p>

<p>“Scilla, ain’ you shame to scandalize de people you
gits yo’ livin’ from?” Susan asked in honest surprise.</p>

<p>“Who? Sis’ Susan, I ain’ say’n nothin’ w’at ain’
true. Is Miss Mimi ever paid you anything for de
many times I comed hyuh an’ borried yo’ gahlic
an’ peppers an’ seas’nin’ an’ things to put in her
vittuls w’en she had big comp’ny to her house?
Try’n to make a show, an’ lookin’ to de niggers to
help her out?... Who? Dat ain’ w’at I calls
principle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“Gal, don’ talk so fas’,” Susan told her. “I’m
knowin’ Miss Mimi ever since she was a baby-chile.”</p>

<p>“But she done los’ her baby-ways now; an’ you ain’
know her since she growed up an’ got ways like
dey say us niggers got.”</p>

<p>“Scilla, you sho is crittacul,” said Tom. “Go ’head
an’ talk w’at you start to talk.”</p>

<p>Scilla looked towards Susan for permission to go
on. Finding no objection, she continued:</p>

<p>“’Tain much to tell. I des wan’ let you know I lef’
Miss Mimi ’cause I des natchally got tired seein’
her losin’ her self-respec’, an’ hyeahin’ w’ite folks
talkin’ ’bout her behin’ her back evvy time dey seen
me. Bein’ a nigger, how could I make ’um shut
dey mouth? So de bes’ thing for me to do was to
quit.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t go ’way hap-hazzud, widout givin’ notice,
did you?” Susan inquired, with a note of severity
in her voice.</p>

<p>“No,” Scilla answered. “We come to a understannin’
a whole day befo’ I lef’.... ’Twas on a
Sad’dy mawnin’; an’ she was goin’ have comp’ny
for dinner de nex’ day; an’ she say she want me to
try and git her some vi’lets for de table, same as I
always bin doin’.</p>

<p>“You see, evvy time she gived a big dinner, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
had to have flowers for de front room an’ de dinner
table; an’ nothin’ but vi’lets would please her. She
ain’ had but a few scat’rin’ vi’lets in her own yard;
so w’at she mus’ do but sen’ me all over Gritny to
git vi’lets from anybody w’at had ’um in dey gahden.—An’
she ain’ offer to pay for ’um, no.</p>

<p>“So you kin un’stan how shame’ I felt;—callin’
at people gate an’ axin’ for vi’lets for Miss Mimi,
an’ ain’ had a dry nickel to pay for ’um.</p>

<p>“One nice w’ite lady dey calls Miss Tillie, always
gimme w’at she had in her gahden. But some dem
stingy Dutch people w’at had plenny vi’lets,
wouldn’ gimme nothin’.</p>

<p>“One day, one ole red-head lady tol’ me I was
lyin’. Dat Miss Mimi ain’ sont me for no vi’lets;
dat I was beggin’ ’um for my own self.... Den
I got mad.—People takin’ me for a fatal rogue;
an’ I ain’ had no way to convince ’um I was jes’
try’n to do de w’ite folks wishes. So I went straight
back an’ give Miss Mimi de complete un’stannin’,
an’ let her know ’bout her position wid de vi’lets de
same as mine. Den I tol’ her I’d come cook de
dinner dat Sunday, an’ help her out wid de comp’ny;
but she cert’ny had to git somebody else to
hunt flowers for her; ’cause it sho made me feel
strange to have all Gritny suspicion me on a cheap
li’l thing like a few scat’ring vi’lets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>As she paused for breath, Tom gave an emphatic
grunt by way of surprise, and asked rather dubiously:</p>

<p>“So da’s how come you quit? I thought w’en you
commence to talk you was goin’ tell somh’n; but
you done talked all ove’ yo’ mouth an’ ain’ tol’
nothin’ yet.”</p>

<p>“Who, Mr. Tom?” Scilla returned, having recovered
sufficiently to being another pasquinade.
“You ain’ think I’m play’n’, is you? Jes’ lemme
git started talkin’ ’bout w’ite folks funny ways,
an’ you sho will lissen w’at I’m tellin’ you....
But lemme shet up,” she added hurriedly; seeing
the form of another visitor entering the front door.
“’Cause hyuh come Mr. Felo; an’ too many witness
ain’ good w’en it come to havin’ a coat-scrape.”</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter5">Felo was a short, stoop-shouldered,
yellow man of about thirty; his face
having a set look which seemed to give the impression
that he was constantly anticipating unpleasant
news. He was dressed in a neat, heterogeneous
fashion, his garments quietly declaring themselves
donations from various male members of his “white
folks family.”</p>

</div>

<p>As he came into the room, he saluted the house with
an eloquent gesture, then exclaimed, raising his
right hand high above his head:</p>

<p>“Peace an’ happiness to de castle; an’ glad titus
(tidings) to who-some-ever gathered hyuh tonight
in Gawd’s name!”</p>

<p>Going over to the fire, he shook hands with Tom;
then turning to the women, said:</p>

<p>“Sis’ Susan, how you do? An’ ole loud-mouth
Scilla, w’at you got to say?”</p>

<p>Scilla laughed good-naturedly at the sally, and before
she could reply, Tom said:</p>

<p>“Leave Scilla stay quiet, Felo, for Gawd sake.
She done talk so till my head feel feev’ish lis’nin’
at her.” Then addressing Scilla, he said: “Gal, shet
yo’ mouth, an’ leave Felo tell us how him an’ Sis’
Fanny gittin’ ’long yonder.”</p>

<p>Sis’ Fanny was Felo’s mother. She was a small,
gentle-mannered, energetic old woman, whose sole
interest in life was the comfort and welfare of her
numerous grandchildren. She sold cakes and vegetables
about the village for a livelihood; accepting
from Felo whatever assistance he felt inclined to
give her from his limited income as butler “to Mr.
Amos house, ’cross de river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“Ma Fanny home, yonder”; Felo answered, “runnin’
roun’ worrin’ ’bout dem no-count chillun. She
well; but she cert’ny a p’ovokin’ ole soul ’bout dat
hog she got yonder. She ain’ sattafy havin’ seven
head o’ chillun to wait on her, but gotta wait
for me to come home from ’way ’cross de river
on Sunday, for me to run all over Gritny to
hunt slop. Da’s w’at make me so late gittin’
hyuh tonight; had to tote slop from fo’ diffunt
places.”</p>

<p>“Who, Mr. Felo?” Scilla exclaimed in astonishment.
“Had to tote slop on Sunday, an’ big All
Saints Day, too?”</p>

<p>“Hog got to eat on Sunday same as people, ain’t
it?” Felo asked, rebukingly.</p>

<p>“You gotta watch out whah you take slop from
dese days, Mr. Felo,” she advised warningly.
“Some people got nice slop, an’ some people slop is
sho treach’ous. My cousin, down de coas’, had a hog
w’at got his th’oat cut clean thoo, from eatin’
slop w’at had razor blades in it. Sho did. An’ ever
since dat time, my cousin make her chillun sif’ evvy
bit o’ slop dey brings home.”</p>

<p>“How come Sis’ Fanny don’ sell de hog?” asked
Susan. “Hog meat bringin’ good price at the
butcher shop dis time o’ year.”</p>

<p>“Da’s w’at I bin tellin’ her”; said Felo, “but she so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
cawntrary she won’ lissen. She say she keepin’ it to
be a mother hog.”</p>

<p>The sudden arrival of Nookie put an end to any
further intimate details which might have embroidered
Felo’s domestic plaint. Her fantastic attire,
as well as her dramatic entrance, made her the immediate
object of attention.</p>

<p>She was a fat, glossy-black young woman, with
shining eyes and teeth, fully conscious of the
charms of both. Her dress was an antiquated blue
silk creation of long-past glory; the skirt much-beruffled;
the basque-front prodigal with “coffee-dipped”
oriental lace, cascading from her neck far
below the waist line. Her hat was a piece of home-evolved
millinery, large and laborious; made of
plaited pink crepe paper, a home-cured sea gull
encompassing its luxuriant dimensions, with outspread,
tethered wings. She carried a long handled
parasol of blue silk, rich in rents and uncovered
ribs; and over her arm was a faded, black cashmere
cape, with remnants of fringe and ravished
beads.</p>

<p>“But no, Nookie!” Susan exclaimed, after she had
recovered from her surprise. “Whah you bin paradin’
today, droped-up in all yo’ curuss clo’se an’
gommux (garments)? Dis ain’ no Mardi Gras
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe Nookie bin yonder to de simmetery to
put flow’hs on somebody grave. You know dis All
Saints day,” volunteered Felo, with a playful smile.
“No I ain’t,” replied Nookie, arranging her lips
with studied care so as to display the whiteness
of her fine teeth. “I des come from up de road;
from seein’ dat ooman w’at give birth to a baby
half-chile an’ half-turtle.”</p>

<p>“Nookie, set down an’ stop yo’ humbug, for Gawd
sake,” said Tom, reprovingly. “You ain’ talkin’
to no chillun.”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Mr. Tom”; she assured him, “I ain’
tellin’ no false. Ain’t you bin read de newspaper
day-befo’ yistiddy? Evvybody was talkin’ ’bout
it. An’ I say: I’m goin’ see for myself. De paper
say dey was goin’ sell it to de Chaddy Hospitle for
$8,000 to put in a’kahol. An’ dey had flocks o’
people goin’ up yonder in misheens to see it. Dey
say de ’ooman husban’ ain’ had nothin’ to do but
stan’ at de front do’ an’ c’leck all dem fifty-censes
in a hat. Dey was chargin’ only a dime; but de
crowd got so plennyful, dey had to raise de price
to fo’-bits. So I thought I better go see befo’ dey
raise it higher.”</p>

<p>As she paused for breath, Susan said to her:</p>

<p>“Nookie, stop yo’ random, an’ talk somh’n people
kin b’lieve w’en dey lissen at you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Sis’ Susan,” declared Nookie with
emotion, “w’at I’m say’n is de dyin’ truth from
hyuh to heav’n. I bin yonder an’ seen de chile, sho’
nuff. An’ I bet if you seen all dem people droppin’
money in de hat, it goin’ make you feel like wishin’
you had bawned de chile yo’ own self. Yas Ma’am,
I bin went to look at it.”</p>

<p>“An’ ain’ seen nothin’ but a ill-form chile,” scoffed
Felo. “Somh’n kin happen to any fam’ly.”</p>

<p>“Who, Mr. Felo?” she retorted. “I know w’at I
seen. I went ’long-side de bed, an’ w’en I look at
him, de chile commence wavin’ his li’l turtle han’
at me, an’ I say: ‘Feet help body!’—An’ I ain’
wait to see no mo’. ’Cause I know if dat thing start
to talk, da’s goin’ be de end o’ de worl’. So I broke
out de house an’ made for de road.”</p>

<p>“An’ runned up in hyuh wid a lie in yo’ mouth,”
Felo added quickly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Felo, g’way from hyuh!” Nookie replied,
with apparent irritation. “You might know a heap
o’ things ’bout keepin’ house for w’ite folks an’
lookin’ after Sis’ Fanny hog yonder, but Gawd
got a whole lot o’ seecut ways you sho don’ know
nothin’ ’bout.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t it true,” commented Susan, with a grunt of
Christian approval.</p>

<p>“Sho is.” Nookie continued. “I know one cullud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
lady back o’ Gritny, was <i>comme ça</i> one time; an’
she went to go take her daughter place an’ wash
for a strange w’ite ooman. An’ w’en she went in de
shed to fix de tubs an’ things, w’en she raise up de
tub, she seen it full o’ duck feathers. Den a li’l
w’ile aft’wuds, w’en her chile was bawn, ’stid it
havin’ natchal furze und’ de arms an’ on de ches’,
like people got; de thing had duck feathers growin’
on him. An’ evvy time it rained w’en he growed up,
he had to go swimmin’ in de cunnal. Sho did. An’
he live’ to be thirty-some-odd years old; w’en he
got drownded try’n to harpoon a buf’lo feesh.”</p>

<p>With a look of playful commiseration, Felo said
to her:</p>

<p>“Gal, come set down to de table an’ take a li’l nur’shment.”
Then addressing Susan: “Give de gal
a plate o’ gumbo, Sis’ Susan. She talkin’ out her
head bein’ hongry an’ patigue aft’ dat long walk
she had up de road.”</p>

<p>Susan got up and filled a plate with gumbo and put
it on the table. Nookie went over to Felo and gave
him a gentle slap of appreciation on the back of
his head, saying to him, as she sat down to eat:</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Mr. Felo, you sho kin read people
mind.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the arrival
of old Uncle Foteen; a venerable, picturesque relic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of antebellum days, leaning heavily on a broom
handle walking stick.</p>

<p>Felo placed a chair for him near the fire; and after
taking his tattered hat and walking stick and putting
them on the bench across the room, Susan
handed him a cup of coffee, giving him kindly
greeting:</p>

<p>“Unc’ Foteen, we sho please’ to see you. You ain’
bin hyuh for a long time. But look like evvything
alright wid you; an’ you got yo’ good strank
yet.”</p>

<p>“Yas, Sis’ Susan,” he replied thoughtfully, nodding
his impressive white head. “Ole Foteen still
hyuh ’munks de livin’ to wait on de fam’ly an’
give thanks in de kingdom. W’en I puts my right
foot down, I say: Thank Gawd. An’ w’en I takes
my lef’ foot up, I say: Praise de Lawd.”</p>

<p>“A-men.” Came the fervent response from Tom.</p>

<p>“Drink yo’ coffee, Unc’ Foteen; an’ lemme fix you
a plate o’ gumbo, an’ you kin eat ’fo de fire to yo’
sattafaction,” said Susan, uncovering the fragrant
pot.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter6">Uncle Foteen had
become a legend in the village, as simple country
people often do. Everybody knew of his connection
with the Guillaume family; and his story of loyalty
and faithful servitude was told again and again
by the new generation of colored people; with admiration
by some, with undue censure by others.
For many years before the Civil War, Uncle Foteen’s
genial usefulness in the Guillaume household
resembled that of Coventry Patmore’s “Briggs,”
who was</p>

<p>Being sometime valet to “ole Marse Sylvain,”
coachman to Mamzelle Olympe, and impressive
major domo of the dining-room on every festive
occasion.</p>

<p>After emancipation was declared, and old Foteen
was given his freedom, he asked to remain with the
family in the old capacity; and he was given a
home in the quarters, rent free as long as he lived;
wages for his services; and was taken care of with
every attention due so worthy a retainer.</p>

<p>One by one, the members of the family passed on
to the Great Beyond, none remaining to enjoy
the luxury of the fine old house and carry on the
splendid family tradition except Madame Guillaume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
and young Sylvain, her son; who was away
availing himself of the benefits of one of the “big
Yankee colleges”;—a fact both abhorrent and inexplicable
to many of Madame’s unreconstructed
Creole friends.</p>

<p>Picturesque and solitary, she lived on through the
changing years, dreaming of the fateful past and
looking forward with childish expectation to the
home-coming of her accomplished son.</p>

<p>Her daily life was ordered with little change from
the old-time dignity and convention: Aunt Choote
and her numerous children looking after the household
and kitchen; Uncle Foteen driving her to
church on Sunday in the old creaking barouche,
taking part in her sentimental reminiscences, and
sharing the fitful dreams and wandering fancies of
forgetfulness that became actualities to both their
weary minds.</p>

<p>One morning old Choote announced to the astonished
members of her family that Madame Guillaume
was “ceasded.”</p>

<p>Going to the bedroom door with the customary
cup of early morning black coffee, there was no
response to her gentle knock. She approached the
bed-side fearfully, and lifting the mosquito net,
found her old Madame “stone-col’, her body hyuh
an’ her soul yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>Young Sylvain being abroad with a party of
tourists, the funeral was held without his being
present. Several weeks later, he was expected
home, and the lonely old house was undergoing
elaborate preparations befitting his return. Uncle
Foteen was going about, a pathetic figure, re-living
the seeming reality of his past importance; mistaking
young Sylvain for his old master, and telling
everyone he met, that “ole Marse Sylvain done
come home, an’ de fam’ly goin’ have big jubilation.”</p>

<p>When Sylvain arrived, Uncle Foteen embraced
him with unrestrained emotion; calling him master;
giving him lively accounts of the imaginary doings
of the departed family; and rejoicing in the prospect
of driving him to church on Sunday, “to show
him off to all Gritny, settin’ up proud in de barouche,
’long wid Ma’am Guillaume, Mamzelle
Olympe, an’ all dem chillun.”</p>

<p>Sylvain soon discovered that the old man’s memory
was uncertain, and he humored his infirmity. “He
bin childish for a good w’ile,” Choote told him.
“An’ he mistake evvbody for somebody else bin
dead a long time.”</p>

<p>Knowing her husband’s vagaries would be overlooked
with understanding sympathy, Choote permitted
Uncle Foteen to take his old post in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
diningroom and preside in the usual, formal way.
When evening came and Sylvain was called to
dinner, he arose to go, a reluctant, solitary guest.
On entering the diningroom, he was amazed to find
the table arranged for six persons. No detail was
overlooked. The guest linen and fine china had
been brought out; cape jasmines, his mother’s
favorite flowers, were in the old rock crystal bowl
as a center piece; and the quaint old silver candlesticks,
lugubrious with towering white candles,
lighted the silent room with an eerie glow he remembered
as a little child. Uncle Foteen, in his
faded uniform, was standing behind his chair,
ready to see him comfortably seated in the master’s
place at the head of the table.</p>

<p>Leaving Sylvain’s chair, he visited the vacant chairs
each in turn, sliding them in place gently, until
each imaginary member of his respected family
was seated in the accustomed manner. Each in
turn, throughout the various courses of the meal,
he visited the spectral guests, watching attentively
as he saw them in fancy helping themselves to the
tempting food; and smiling with grateful pleasure
on beholding his honored family gathered once
more in convivial assembly.</p>

<p>It was a well-known tale in the village; a tale
Uncle Foteen loved to repeat. The facts were real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to him; the occasion, a memorable one; and the
actors, living personalities. No one thought of
arguing with him the verity of his story, or regarding
his vision as a worthless, fleeting dream. It was
a fancy that brought him comfort and solace to
brighten the hours of his waning years. He knew
that his beloved white folks lived again, and he
walked and talked with their gentle spirits wherever
he happened to be.</p>

before the pleasant fire enjoying his plate of
gumbo with childish satisfaction, apparently oblivious
of the rumble of conversation in the room.</p>

<p>“Po’ ole soul sho havin’ a party by his own self wid

disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Go ’long, gal, wid yo’ reckless talk,” said Susan.
“Leave Plunkum come back home tomorrow, an’
nobody but <i>you</i> goin’ turn out full fo’ce to give him
welcome; an’ you know it good.”</p>

<p>“Who, me, Sis’ Susan? It be only one way you
see me turn out to give Plunkum welcome. An’
dat’ll be to cut his head in fo’ diffunt ways,—shawt
an’ long, an’ wide an’ deep. An’ cut de palms his
feets in de bargain, so he can’t run no mo’. Yas
Ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Nookie,” said Tom, speaking
slowly, “for a young ooman w’at bin well-raise’,
you sho kin make a whole lot o’ nigger noise.”</p>

<p>“Anybody come to be a nigger, Mr. Tom, w’en dey
git mixed up wid a nasty Pharisee like ole
Plunkum ... layin’ up in my house for seven
long mont’s aft’ he done marry me lawful; livin’ on
my good bounty, an’ ain’ done a lick o’ work, an’
ain’ thinkin’ ’bout doin’ none; lookin’ for me to
feed an’ suppoat him; an’ raisin’ a roocus w’en I
refuse to leave him put on de w’ite folks clo’se I
was washin’, so’s he could go ’long wid de Odd
Fellows purrade an’ strut like Pompey!...
Who?... You know yo’self, Mr. Tom, Gawd
ain’ goin’ be patient wid a rogue like dat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“An’ it tuck you seven long mont’s to make up
yo’ min’ ’bout Plunkum ways?” Scilla asked, quizzically.</p>

<p>“I was lookin’ ove’ my min’ for a long time ’bout
w’at I was goin’ do,” she answered. “But my passion
struck me all at once. So one evenin’, w’en
Plunkum had plague’ me so till I des couldn’ stan’
it no longer; I up wid my potato-stomper was
stannin’ on de pot shelf, an’ I played de thing all
up an’ down de back his head, till he vomit....
Den w’en I seen him look so mizzabul an’ downcas’;
I went an’ fix him some sedlitz powders to
quiet him.</p>

<p>“I fix de blue paper one in a cup o’ water firs’,
an’ made him drink it; den I fix de w’ite paper one
in de cup, an’ made him drink dat.... An’ people,
you ain’ goin’ b’lieve me w’en I tell you; ’twasn’
no time befo’ dey had to ride him to de hospital
in de groc’ry wagon, de tawment inside him was
carryin’ him such a road! Yas Lawd.... Dat
nigger was fit to explode any minute. An’ he sho
did holler an’ cry.</p>

<p>“W’at dey did to him yonder, I ain’ never hyeah’d
tell. But he mus’ bin make up his min’ to go some
yuther direction; ’cause Plunkum ain’ <i>never</i> come
back to my house.”</p>

<p>“An’ you call yo’self a Chrishtun, an’ practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
devilment like dat?” Felo asked, reprovingly. “Is
Plunkum any child o’ Gawd?” she asked, indignantly.
“De Bible say: overcome yo’ enemy;
don’t it?... Plunkum ain’ nothin’ but gutter
water!”</p>

<p>The running laughter of the women at this juncture
broke into a merry peal. Uncle Foteen awakened
from a pleasant doze and looked around
bewildered, just as the stentorian sound of a man’s
voice was heard outside, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Great-day-in-de-mawnin’! Who is you? Makin’
all dis racket up in hyuh so soon, an’ night ain’
begin to fall good yet.”</p>

<p>Coming into the room, he announced himself:</p>

<p>“Good evenin’ to evvbody; an’ peace to de hyuhafter.”</p>

<p>Pointing to a chair near Tom, Susan said to him:</p>

<p>“Take a chair, an’ set down, Nat; an’ take dat hat
off yo’ head w’en you come befo’ comp’ny.”</p>

<p>Nat rolled his large, shining eyes at her in playful
annoyance, and walked over to the chair and sat
down; throwing his hat across the floor with a
sweeping gesture.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter8">Nat was a notable personality
in the village, and was the exclusive pride
and perennial delight of every one along the coast.
He was a composite of farmer, philosopher and
clown; with the face of a contemplative monk and
the manner of a harmless mountebank. He was
very black and very bow-legged; the latter being
accepted by him as a fortunate asset rather than a
calamity. It served him as an individual trade mark
in his calling, which was that of truck gardening.
His vegetables, he declared, were unlike the product
of any other planters of seeds; they were distinctive,
facsimiles of himself, and he took great
pleasure in making it known. Everybody knew his
“bow-legged punkins an’ bow-legged egg-plants”;
and no other vendor could boast of the “bow-legged
butterbeans and fat bow-legged squash”
like Nat’s.</p>

</div>

<p>He peddled his seasonable wares through the village
in a large, flat basket made of willow slats,
placed on top of a clumsy sled built of rough-hewn
cypress fence pickets, dragged by an unshorn,
meditative old mule he called Maybe-so. Walking
bare-footed Nat followed behind; his loose-fitting
blue cottonade trousers flapping about his dusty
ankles; a broad-brimmed Chinese-looking hat made
of palmetto, tilted humorously on his round woolly
head.</p>

<p>As he went along, he kept up a confidential conversation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
with the mule, about the weather; the
condition of the road; the pest of bugs on the young
potato plants; or any subject that occupied his
mind when he was not vociferating the virtues of
his bow-legged merchandise to attract the attention
of chance customers.</p>

<p>He also had a company of two or three nondescript
dogs following in his wake. They seemed to
understand all his moods and movements; looking
at him with rapt interest when he talked to them;
and watching with appealing glances when he
shouted some vehement command. They knew they
were not to move another step when they heard
him call to Maybe-so, and saw the old mule stop
before the gate of one of his regular customers.
They would sit down in the road precipitously and
wait patiently while an argument ensued; and as
soon as orders were given to march, they rose up
with renewed anticipation; and with tails erect,
they started off as soon as Maybe-so made the first
step.</p>

<p>If at any time they disregarded the rule, Nat
would call to the mule to halt; the dogs would be
reprimanded for being “too much in a hurry,” and
would be told to “wait till Nat’s ready to go. Nat
ain’ fol’rin’ you; you fol’rin’ <i>Nat</i>.”</p>

<p>Whether they wanted to buy or not, the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
came out to greet him as soon as they heard the
sound of his superb voice. He would stand in the
road and call out his rhythmic chant, announcing
himself, his wares, his companionable mule and
family of dogs:</p>

</div>

<p>After the bartering was finished, Nat would take
up the reins again; and as soon as the mule heard
him say, “Nat’s gone,” off he would start; the
dogs following with wagging tails, apparently
pleased with the thought of another pilgrimage.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter9">Susan crossed the room
and picked up the hat from the floor where Nat
had thrown it, and as she hung it on the rack, said
to him:</p>

</div>

<p>“You mus’ bin strollin’ out today. I see you got
on yo’ shoes an’ a clean shirt, an’ done took off yo’
cottonade breeches; but you ain’ laid aside dis ole
palmeeter hat. W’at Rose doin’, she can’t look
after you no better, an’ make you dress yo’self
’cawdin’ to de season?”</p>

<p>“Rose too busy, Sis’ Susan.” he answered.</p>

<p>“W’at Rose got to do make her so busy?” she
asked in surprise. “Nobody but Roxy an’ you in
de house to bother ’bout, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Rose ’tenshun so taken up wid dat sweet Lucy
wine she git yonder to Mr. Camille sto’, Sis’
Susan, she don’ know de diffunce twix’ July an’
Janawerry.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t Roxy ole enough to take charge an’ look
aft’ yo’ clo’se an’ things for you?” asked Felo.</p>

<p>“Roxy ole enough,” Nat answered assuringly,
“but she too occapied lookin’ aft’ dem boys, an’
makin’ matrimony wid evvy one comin’ ’long de
road.”</p>

<p>“Unc’ Nat, ain’t you shame?” Scilla exclaimed.
“Settin’ hyuh befo’ all dese people, scand’lizin’ yo’
own chile name like dat?”</p>

<p>“Roxy ain’ shame, is she?” he replied bluntly. “She
ain’ talkin’ ’bout it, but dat ain’ keepin’ people
from knowin’ she totin’ somh’n under her a-pun
right now, is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Y’oughta chastise her if you feel sho you ain’
makin’ no mistake,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Mistake or no mistake,” commented Nookie,
“y’oughta quit yo’ blabbin’ ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“W’at y’all mean?” Nat asked with impatience.
“Roxy ain’ commit no terr’ble crime, is she? She
ain’t hurt nobody fatal. Roxy ain’ did nothin’ but
follow de feelin’s of a natchal ooman, curuss to
know somh’n convincin’ concernin’ de seecut
workin’ of a ’ooman life. An’ all she done was de
li’l thing some foolish ole misun’stannin’ people
done classify in de bad lis’ und’ de headin’ o’ sinful
ways.”</p>

<p>“Den you means to uphol’ Roxy ’long de brazen
road she takin’?” asked Scilla, staring at him in
amazement.</p>

<p>He deliberated a few seconds, then answered:</p>

<p>“I means to keep my min’ from gittin’ upset ’bout
somh’n I ain’ got no cuntrol over. Roxy jus’ like
she come hyuh to dis life; wid evvything jus’ like
’twus inten’ to be. An’ Roxy ain’ no diffunt from
you an’ no yuther wimmins. An’ nature ways is
Gawd ways; an’ I ain’ got no right to meddle. An’
you can’t say I ain’ correck, if you wan’ leave
yo’self tell de true.”</p>

<p>“Dah, bless Gawd!” Felo exclaimed with enthusiasm.
“Unc’ Nat, you sho spoke somh’n dat time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“W’at you know ’bout wimmin ways, ole ugly
Felo?” Nookie inquired indignantly. “Is you done
come to be a big jedge, like all de yuther hypocrite
niggers w’at spen’ all dey time livin’ ’munks de
w’ite folks?... Lookin’ down scawnful on yo’
own color ways; tryin’ to make us nigger people
pattun aft’ de w’ite folks?”</p>

<p>“Anybody heard me say a word ’bout w’ite folks
bein’ diffunt?” Felo demanded, looking about from
one to the other. “Far as I bin able to ’zern, dey
ways resemble each-another. Only de w’ite folks
ways mo’ seecut.... Dey thinks a heap ’bout
w’at dey doin’. Dey does it on de sly. ’Tain’ nobody
business.... But you never see ’um lose
dey self-respec’. Dey puts on a front, an’ dey all
gits by. Dey hides dey looseness, an’ you gotta
give ’um praise. But look at de cullud folks. How
dey do?... Dey ain’ stop to bother ’bout self-respec’;
w’at people goin’ think. Dey jus’ cuts
loose.... Dey natchal as de cattle an’ fowls’ an’
things. An’ <i>Gawd</i> de only man to tell if dey doin’
somh’n wrong.”</p>

<p>Apprehensive that an unpleasant dispute was
under way, Susan said to them:</p>

<p>“Y’all better stop talkin’ to one-’nother so plain.
Firs’ thing you know, you goin’ be sorry.”</p>

<p>Almost immediately she became aware that her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
fears were needless; for she heard outside the
sound of voices mingled with the drone of weird
music played on a comb covered with tissue paper;
and she knew that other members had arrived.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter10">The new-comers were
Carmelite and Soongy, two pleasant-looking,
neatly-dressed young colored women; accompanied
by a light brown-skin boy about fourteen
years old, known to every one as Dink, the comb-player.
He was a merry-faced, accommodating
young troubadour, willing to lend his talent on
any chance occasion; making his ravishing music
on the comb for the sheer love of the thing itself,
and the simple reward of a “plate full o’ vittuls
an’ a cup o’ somh’n-’nother to drink.”</p>

</div>


<p>Soongy was his aunt, and was extravagantly proud
of his musical ability. “Dink ain’ no master min’ by
no means”; she would say, when speaking of his
attainments, “but he sho got it all in his head. An’
nobody ain’ learned him, either.”</p>

<p>Dink’s repertoire was a remarkable one. It included
all the “himes” and mellows and “Dr.
Watts” sung by the Baptist and Methodist congregations,
reaching from “Wes’wego ferry landin’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
clean down de coas’ to Gritny in de Eas’ Green”;
all the “ballets” and “sinful songs” disseminated
by “backsliders” and “evil-workers”; and many
haunting fragments of “make-up songs,” the invention
of Dick’s harmonious mind.</p>

<p>His voice, whether used for singing, or for making
music through the comb, was true and melodious;
having the clear, sensuous timbre of adolescence
that won the admiration of his most orthodox
listeners. “De Sperret goin’ stop his shoo-fly ways
one dese days; an’ den dey ain’ goin’ be <i>nobody</i>
kin tetch him raisin’ his voice to give Gawd de
praise he done helt back for so long;” the old
church members would comment, after having
listened to some of the “shoo-fly ballets.”</p>

<p>After friendly greetings were exchanged all
around, and the new arrivals were seated comfortably,
Susan asked Carmelite:</p>

<p>“W’at you doin’ on dis side de river tonight? You
ain’ give up yo’ place to Miss Newgeem house,
is you?”</p>

<p>“Yas ma’am,” Carmelite answered languidly. “I
bin lef’ her a long time.”</p>

<p>“An’ you ain’ doin’ nothin’?” Susan questioned.</p>

<p>“Yas ma’am; I ain’ idle,” she answered reassuringly.
“I’m sewin’ on quilts, yonder to my house.
An’ I sho got some nice ones to sell. Made out o’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
all kind o’ pretty scraps I gethered up ’munks de
w’ite folks; an’ dey ain’ cos’ me a nickel.”</p>

<p>With calm misgiving, Susan asked her:</p>

<p>“An’ quilts goin’ suppoat you an’ put clo’se on yo’
back, an’ puvvide you wid shoes an’ vittuls an’
things?”</p>

<p>“If I can’t sell ’um, I sho kin raffle ’um.” Carmelite
answered with conviction. “An’ make much
as I made workin’ up in Miss Newgeem scrooched-up
kitchen; onsatafied an’ fretful as I was all de
time.”</p>

<p>“I thought you was please wid de place,” ventured
Scilla.</p>

<p>“Who? Miss Newgeem de wrong one to make people
feel please. She got such fussy ways, she ain’
to be please her <i>own</i> self. So da’s w’at make me
quit an’ go yonder to my quilts; whah I ain’ had
to worry ’bout bein’ plagued all day long.”</p>

<p>“But Carm’lite,” began Soongy, by way of pleasant
argument, “don’t you fin’ sewin’ on quilts is
mo’ taxin’ work den cookin’ for a small fam’ly
like Miss Newgeem got? I fin’ it mo’ combinin’,
me.”</p>

<p>“’Tain de cookin’, Soongy,” Carmelite explained.
“It’s all de hum-bug you gotta do: passin’ de
dishes thoo hot water befo’ you brings ’um to de
table. An’ a fresh plate for evvy diffunt dish dey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
has to eat. An’ you know yo’self, how long it take
for dishes to dreen aft’ you done pass ’um thoo
hot water, an’ dey gotta be wipe besides.</p>

<p>“An’ Miss Newgeem got a whole lot o’ Japanee
china dishes so thin you kin see thoo ’um, an’ you
gotta be careful how you tetch ’um. So one day,
I say to myself: I’m goin’ put de things in de
oven an’ heat ’um all at once an’ be done. So I
put de plates an’ de cups in de oven, an’ push de
stove-do’ half-to, an’ set down to wait on ’um.
An’ chile! Aft’ a w’ile, I could hyeah dem things
crackin’ up in de oven,—an’ I ain’ never had <i>tetch</i>
’um.</p>

<p>“An’ w’en I open de stove-do’ an’ looked at ’um,—chile,
de dishes was so wreckded, it took me <i>three</i>
dish towels to pull out <i>one</i> plate.”</p>

<p>“You had good sense to go yonder to yo’ quilts,”
Felo murmured in a humorous undertone.</p>

<p>“I was goin’ leave her any way, so dat ain’ bin de
thing made me quit,” Carmelite answered, artlessly.
“Miss Newgeem des natchally had too
much shiftin’ o’ de dishes for de fewness o’ de
vittuls; an’ I ain’ never bin used to eatin’ light.”
At this reference to food, Susan became conscious
of a sense of lax hospitality, whereupon she said:
“Dey got plenny gumbo in dat pot you see stannin’
on de h’af; an’ plenny sweet potato pies yonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
in de safe; so you ain’ need to feel strange ’bout
breakin’ yo’ fas’—lessen you bin et heavy befo’
you come hyuh dis evenin’.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was opportune. Smiles of appreciation
from one to the other showed that the invitation
was agreeable to all.</p>

<p>Susan went to the safe and distributed plates to
the women, and Nat and Felo began placing chairs
around the table. She filled the plates with a generous
portion of snowy rice and fragrant gumbo,
and the women arranged them on the shining new
oil cloth.</p>

<p>“Great-day-in-de-mawnin’!” Nat exclaimed. “Sis’
Susan, you sho spoons out dat gumbo wid a tantalizin’
scent! Set down, members, an’ smack yo’
lips; an’ Gawd bless de cook for de feas’ dis
evenin’.”</p>

<p>They gathered about the table with lively interest
and sat down and began eating. Uncle Foteen
was sleeping quietly before the fire. Dink was
sitting across the room, looking on with wistful
glances, and making querulous music on the comb.
On discovering his aloofness, Susan called to
him: “Boy, put dat comb out yo’ han’, an’ come
set to de table an’ eat yo’ vittuls. You ain’ hongry?”</p>

<p>Looking at her timidly, Dink answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Yassam. But I come ’way from home in a hurry,
an’ my haid ain’ comb’.”</p>

<p>Susan studied his face for a second, then said reprovingly:</p>

<p>“Boy, take dat comb you got in yo’ han’ an’ pass
it thoo’ yo’ head, den come set to de table.”</p>

<p>Having a better knowledge of the nature of Dink’s
hirsute endowment than Susan had, Soongy came
to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Leave ’im be, Sis’ Susan,” she told her. “Leave
’im eat whah he settin’. Wid dem grape-twisses
Dink got on ’is head, it’ll take ’im all night to git
thoo bat’lin wid ’um.”</p>

<p>Accepting the plausibility of Soongy’s statement,
Susan took Dink a plate of gumbo and left him
to enjoy it in his quiet corner alone. She went back
to the table to see that Tom was made thoroughly
comfortable, and to ply her guests with coffee and
pies, and refill their plates with rice and gumbo if
they wanted more. Their enjoyment was keen
and genuine; enlivened with much playful banter
and merry laughter, and amusing gossip about the
doings and sayings of the “w’ite folks;” which,
after a while, developed into a sort of philosophic
commentary.</p>

<p>Nat’s oratory was in full flower, and Felo applauded
him, an encouraging ally. Always unorthodox<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in his views, his over-enthusiasm now became
offensive to the women, and their dissenting
voices began to fill the room with shrill echoes.
Susan realized that a harsh dispute was imminent
and something had to be done to prevent it. The
fortuitous whimpering of Dink’s comb arrested
her attention, and she welcomed the plaintive
sound as a divine interruption. Fixing her eyes on
the front door, she arose from her chair with unusual
energy, and tapping her spoon on her plate
with a ringing sound, she called out:</p>

<p>“Stop dis racket up in hyuh! Y’all take my house
for a honky-tonk? Quit yo’ racket an’ try an’ talk
like people.”</p>

<p>Her positive tone brought immediate silence.
Everyone looked uneasily towards the door, anticipating
the entrance of some accusing moderator
of the peace. Seeing no one appear, Nat said:</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Sis’ Susan, you oughta stop play’n
chillun tricks, ole as you is. W’at sattafaction you
fin’ try’n to frighten people like dat?”</p>

<p>“You ain’ too ole to make racket, is you?” Susan
asked quietly. “An’ w’at sattafaction you fin’,
mult’plyin’ words an’ ’sputin’ wid wimmins till you
stirs ’um up to hot blood an’ spiteful wranglin’,—an’
und’ my roof, too? W’at you gotta say ’bout
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“For Gawd sake, stop y’all quoilin’ an’ set down,”
interposed Tom. “Y’all had to wait till big Sunday
to gether hyuh an’ make a ruckus?... Susan,
whah dat boy gone wid de comb? Tell him to blow
music on de thing an’ change dese niggers ’maginashun.”</p>

<p>A second request was unnecessary. Dink’s appetite
being gratefully appeased, his mental attitude
was one of harmonious sociability. Adjusting
the tissue paper on his comb, he put the outlandish
instrument to his lips and began playing with spirit
the old shout called “De W’ite Horse Pawin’ in
de Valley.” The merry melody floated through
the room, the infectious lilt taking possession of
the listeners’ thoughts and holding them captives
to its insistent appeal. They began to sway gently
to-and-fro, their bodies, like their minds, intoxicated
by the captivating rhythm. The women began
to hum; a low, melodious hum, like the far-away
sound of a colony of wood birds awakening
at day-break. Then the men joined the humming,
and the sound recalled the droning of distant village
church bells, floating over quiet fields at
sunset. And the mingling of the voices made one
think of the rumbling of November winds chasing
among the telegraph wires.</p>

<p>After a while, Felo began to sing the narrative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
lines of the song, the others taking up the burden,
and responding with growing fervor after each
line:</p>

  </div>

<p>Then like a majestic wave of sound, rose the noble
refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In de valley, my Lawd,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On my knees;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Down on my knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I seen de w’ite horse pawin’ in de valley.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then back again to the tuneful story of adventure
in the land of the spirit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who heard my pray’rs w’en I prayed in de wilderness?</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">(W’ite horse pawin’ in de valley).”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the chorus again, full, swinging and triumphant:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">I seen de w’ite horse pawin’ in de valley.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tuneful tumult awakened
Uncle Foteen from his peaceful sleep, and he
looked around the room bewildered, uncertain of
his whereabouts. What did the gathering mean?
Why were they sitting around the long white table,
singing church songs? Whose wake was it? Who
were they waiting for in the dim, lamp-lighted
room?</p>

<p>Looking at Susan appealingly, he asked:</p>

<p>“He ain’ come yet?”</p>

<p>She went over to the old man, and said to him
quietly:</p>

<p>“Evvything alright, Unc’ Foteen. You bin
sleepin’.”</p>

<p>Looking at her thoughtfully, he said with tremulous
voice:</p>

<p>“If dat candle burn out befo’ Marse Sylvain git<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
hyuh, we gotta put Ma’am Guillaume away. You
know, we ain’ ’lowed to keep her too long.”</p>

<p>“Unc’ Foteen, lemme fix you some coffee an’
milk,” Susan said pleasantly; meaning to divert
the old man’s thoughts. “An’ you all members,
stop w’at you singin’,” she called to the chorus,
“an’ sing somh’n w’at goin’ make Unc’ Foteen feel
gay.”</p>

<p>Obeying Susan’s request, Dink began playing a
rollicking melody on the comb; patting his foot
vehemently on the brick-sprinkled floor, to mark
the even time.</p>

<p>“Boy!” Felo called out to him indignantly, causing
Dink to immediately stop playing. “Quit yo’
ratty music, an’ play somh’n decen’ w’at goes wid
Sunday an’ fittin’ for Chrishtun people to sing.”</p>

<p>“Don’ pay ’im no ’tenshun, li’l boy,” Susan interposed.
“Dis house my meetin’-house; an’ if dey
got people in de buildin’ displease wid de himes
an’ music an’ things, den leave ’um go some yuther
place an’ hunt till dey finds de thing w’at suits
’um. So go ’head, li’l boy, an’ play an’ sing jes’ like
yo’ min’ tell you.”</p>

<p>Further objection was useless after this declaration.
Dink laid his comb on the bench along-side
of him, and leaning back against the wall, began
singing gaily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“W’en de moon be riz</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">How come evvy night I see you watchin’ for me?...</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Lessen it be w’en de clouds is po’in down rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a glorious moment. He knew that he was
soloist supreme; that the song was his individual
possession, and nobody would venture to sing it
with him. He had them in his power. He would
make Felo listen, whether or no. Almost rapturously
he went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go ’long, moon,</div>

    <div class="verse indent4">Her w’at you hyeah come singin’ yonder in de lane.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having reached the end of the verse, his eyes
skimmed the room for looks of approval. Several
of the listeners were smiling appreciatively. Drawing
a deep breath, he extended his chest imposingly,
and went on with the chorus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Dink finished his happy serenade, Nat called
to him:</p>

<p>“Boy, come over hyuh an’ tell me how ole you is.”</p>

<p>Dink looked appealingly at his aunt, and as he
crossed over to Nat’s chair, Soongy answered for
him:</p>

<p>“He be fifteen years ole nex’ June, Unc’ Nat.”</p>

<p>“Boy, you sho got a gif’ straight from Gawd,
quiv’in’ in dat th’oat o’ yone,” Nat said to him,
patting him on the head patronizingly.</p>

<p>“A gif’ straight from de devil,” muttered Felo,
looking at Nat and batting his eyelids with impatience.</p>

<p>Nat reflected a while on the difference of opinion,
then asked drily:</p>

<p>“Since w’en you got to be so frien’ly wid de devil,
he done showed you how to make ’videnashun
’twix w’at b’lonks to him an’ w’at b’lonks to
Gawd?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“Is Gawd give people gif’s to th’ow ’way, tellin’
’bout devilment,—goin’ ’round singin’ all kind o’
sinful random; ’stid o’ raisin’ up dey voice to give
praise to de things Gawd done sanctify?”</p>

<p>“W’at things de boy tol’ about in de song you
cunsider Gawd ain’ sanctify?” Nat asked solemnly.
“Can’t be de man watchin’ for de moon to
come up behin’ de ’simmon tree. Dat ain’ natchal?
Gawd ain’ sen’ de moon to shine, an’ make de
water move, an’ help de plants to grow in de
groun’, an’ give light so people kin know de right
road from de wrong?—Dat ain’ natchal?...
An’ Gawd ain’ make de sap rise in de young ooman
an’ de young man, stirrin’ ’um up like de sap
stirrin’ in de ’simmon tree, till dey feels somh’n

on. “Dat ain’ natchal?</p>

<p>“An’ Gawd ain’ make de mawkin’-bird sing, settin’
in de aw’inge tree in de moonlight whah ’is ole

mo’, befo’ you go ’roun’ hyuh preachin’ to people so
biggidy.”</p>

<p>Appearing fully satisfied with the delivery of his
colorful remonstrance, Nat turned to Dink and
said quietly:</p>

<p>“Boy, go yonder an’ play on yo’ comb till you
make dese squinched-up niggers ’maginashun
change, an’ dey finds out dat de sperret got yuther
ways o’ movin’ ’um ’sides preachin’ on Bible texes

<p>“Dah, bless Gawd!” Nookie exclaimed. “Unc’ Nat
done win. Done put Mr. Felo out on a home run.”</p>

<p>“Felo ain’ gone, is he?” Tom inquired.</p>

<p>“No. Felo hyuh,” Susan told him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Felo, you ain’ goin’, is you?” Scilla asked
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Who?” Felo replied, with calm amazement. “Felo
goin’ stay right hyuh wid y’all till de party break
up.”</p>

<p>His resolve was greeted with merry laughter and
good-natured raillery; during which, Dink went
back to his seat and began playing on the comb:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>
<p>He came to the refrain, and every voice took up
the words, singing with increasing fervor, until the
song rolled like a pæan of deliverance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The stirring refrain was drawing towards the end,
when the door opened and another member came in.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter11">The new-comer was a
man about thirty years old; known to everybody
in the village as Gussie Fisky. He was well-built;
with a wealth of unkempt, reddish-blond hair, and
a shaggy mustache of the same color. His eyes
were large and gray, and stared with a reckless, determined
air. His complexion was one of remarkable
sallowness; and his features, while plain and
commonplace, were free from every negroid characteristic;
having certain regularities of cast that
declared him indubitably a white man, however
ordinary the extraction.</p>

</div>

<p>A strange mystery surrounded Gussie’s origin. A
mystery known to no one except old Aunt Fisky,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the kindly colored woman with whom he lived,
the only mother he had ever known.</p>

<p>There were many legends related regarding Gussie’s
origin, his birth, and his abandonment by
his white family; some ribald, some romantic; any
of which Gussie never troubled himself to comment
on or disprove. He knew that he was white; that
Aunt Fisky had raised him from infancy, and had
given him her name; that he had lived his inconsequent
years among illiterate Negroes; that it was
sheer madness to hope to be received as a fellow-man
by white people who despised him; and that life
was nothing more than a merry game for anyone
who could play it with a reckless spirit.</p>

<p>And so he spent his days among his chosen companions,
resigned to his humble fate; satisfied with
old Aunt Fisky’s motherly attentions, and the
squalid atmosphere of the poor shanty they called
home; comfortable with the boisterous young colored
women who permitted him to bestow upon
them the freedom of his prodigal affection; and
companionable with the roustabouts and longshoremen
with whom he worked and gambled and caroused;
imbibing their thoughts and ideas, adopting
their dialect, and imitating their manners and
ways.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter12">Gussie came lumbering
into the room, scanning the faces of the
singers nervously. Finding himself suddenly yielding
to the melody’s insistent appeal, he lifted his
raucous voice to join the chorus just as the song
came to an end.</p>

</div>

<p>With a disappointed look, he asked:</p>

<p>“W’at y’all stop for? Go ’head agin, an’ lemme
sing wid you.”</p>

<p>“W’at you know ’bout singin’, ole w’ite nigger?”
Felo asked, half-jestingly. “Sho time to stop, w’en
you come lopin’ up in hyuh an’ wan’ sing.”</p>

<p>It was a thrust that went deeper than Felo intended.
Gussie understood that the feeling with
which he was accepted by his colored companions
was something more like tolerance than a feeling
of genuine friendship; and the fact, unpleasant as
it was, made him conscious of a natural sense of
race pride and prejudice not easily overlooked.</p>

<p>With an indignant glare at Felo, he said:</p>

<p>“I know I’m w’ite, ole ugly nigger. But you ain’
got to tell me ’bout it. I bin knowin’ you ever sence
we was chillun playin’ together; but you ain’ need
to talk like dat befo’ all dis crowd.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Gussie,” Susan called to him quietly, “put yo’
hat yonder, an’ set down, an’ don’ ack so boist’us.
You ain’ bin hyuh for over three weeks, an’ now
you come an’ wan’ raise a confusion? Go set down
an’ ack like people.”</p>

<p>Taking in the awkwardness of the situation with
admirable tact, Carmelite asked:</p>

<p>“Gussie, how much Aun’ Fisky chahges for a dozen
duck aigs? I got one muskovy duck home yonder I
wan’ set befo’ de weather git too col’.”</p>

<p>“She bin gittin’ two-bits a dozen for ’um.” Gussie
answered sullenly. “But she ain’ got no mo’,
now.”</p>

<p>“You mean she done sol’ all her ducks?” Carmelite
persisted.</p>

<p>“No. She done sol’ all de aigs she had to Mr.
Gully baker-shop.”</p>

<p>“Go ’way from hyuh, Gussie,” Carmelite answered,
laughing. “W’at Mr. Gully wan’ do wid duck aigs
in a baker-shop?”</p>

<p>“To put in de cake for de weddin’, las’ night.”</p>

<p>“Who? Dey had a weddin’ yonder in Gritny las’
night?” Inquired Susan, eager to hear further particulars.</p>

<p>“Yas’m.” Gussie replied, becoming more amiable.
“Dat w’ite ooman dey call Maggie Hutson. ’Twas
her weddin.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Lawd!” exclaimed Nookie in tones of great surprise.
“You mean to say ole Maggie Hutson done
got her a husban’, aft’ de sinful life she bin carryin’
all dese years up an’ down de road wid so many
diffunt mens?... Lawd! Gussie, tell it agin; so
I kin lissen if w’at you tellin’ is somh’n true.”</p>

<p>“Sho Gawd is.” Gussie assured her. “Maggie got
her one husban’; an’ had her one sho-nuff weddin’,
wid all de church bells ringin’; went ridin’ all thoo
de town, settin’ back on de ca’idge seat ’long-side
her fright’nes’-lookin’ skinny old man; wid a
weepin’ veil hangin’ down ove’ her face, an’ a
aw’inge flower wreath settin’ ’cross her fawid; jes’
a-bowin’ an’ smilin’ at people, like she wan’ show
’um she kin put on wreath an’ veil even if she is
look like somebody come off a bad street.... Sho
did. ’Twas like a fatal purrade goin’ roun’ Gritny.”</p>

<p>“Lawd, people! Lissen w’at Gussie sayin’.” Nookie
exclaimed, laughing heartily. “Settin’ up in a
ca’idge, wid aw’inge flowers on her head, brazen as
she is! Lawd, people! Don’t you know da’s comical?”</p>

<p>“W’at make Maggie ain’ got de right to put
aw’inge flowers in her head if da’s her pleasure?”
Came Nat’s dissenting voice. “Y’all niggers sho
like to fin’ somh’n wrong wid yuther people ways.
Maggie got a right to put mustud-greens, an’ twis’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
cow-pea vines in her head if she fin’ it make her
look good; an’ if da’s de way her min’ be workin’.”</p>

<p>“But, Unc’ Nat,” Scilla essayed to explain in behalf
of the sisterhood, “de wimmins gotta think a
li’l somh’n ’bout form an’ fashion, ain’t dey?...
Wearin’ aw’inge flowers public like dat sho is redic’lus;
cheap as Maggie bin made herself yonder
in Gritny wid de mens.”</p>

<p>Getting up from his chair and gesticulating with
both arms, as though addressing a crowd on an
open road, Felo called out:</p>

<p>“Stan’ back, members! Stan’ back, an’ make room.
’Cause us sanctified sisters done commence pitchin’
rocks an’ stones.”</p>

<p>“Scilla ain’ spoke nothin’ w’at ain’ true,” Gussie
interposed. “Evvybody yonder know Maggie hist’ry.”</p>

<p>At this point Susan’s rumination became audible:
“An’ all dem w’at don’t, dey ain’ goin’ be long
findin’ out, w’en yo’ mouf start runnin’.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help from knowin’ w’at I know, Aun’
Susan,” Gussie replied hurriedly in self-vindication.
“Ain’ I bin worked for Maggie, spadin’ her
garden, an’ w’ite-washin’ her kitchen; an’ bin had
de freedom o’ de whole house, day-time an’ night-time,
too?”</p>

<p>With sharp impatience Nat called to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Stop right whah you is, Gussie; befo’ you try to
make we-all b’lieve you had de freedom o’ somh’n
else besides.”</p>

<p>Laughing boisterously, Gussie said:</p>

<p>“Money ain’ nothin’ but money w’en somebody got
somh’n to sell, ain’t it?... An’ one man ain’ look
much diffunt from a yuther man in de dark,—even
if he do be w’ite.”</p>

<p>A sudden reprimand from Susan interrupted his
laughter.</p>

<p>“Look, Gussie!” He heard her call. “Black or
w’ite,—w’ichever color you wan’ call it,—but you
ain’ in no bar-room. Either yonder on de levee-front.
So you better talk diffunt talk, if you wanna
stay hyuh a li’l w’ile soshable dis evenin’.”</p>

<p>“I ain’ try’n to ack ugly, Aun’ Susan.” Gussie
insisted. “I jes’ wan’ p’int out how Maggie try’n
to make herself look like somh’n she <i>ain’t</i>. Da’s
all.”</p>

<p>Nat leaned forward in his chair, and clasping his
knees with his brawny black hands, braced himself
for a philosophic argument.</p>

<p>“Nobody ain’ wan’ dispute Gussie dat he bin seen
de aw’inge flowers an’ things Maggie had settin’ on
top her head,” he went on. “But w’at we does wan’
know: Is Gussie bin able to see de change w’at
moughta took place in Maggie tahminashun; an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
w’at de feelin’ inside de ’ooman was,—direckin’
Maggie to do w’at she was cunsider right?...
You know de sperret ways is sho myste’rous. An’
people gotta move accawdin’, w’en it strike you
un-beknownce.”</p>

<p>“Yas, Lawd.” Came a fervid antiphon of soprano
voices.</p>

<p>“Who?... Yas indeed.” Carmelite agreed.
“Sweet man Jesus is a heart-fixer an’ a mind-regalator,
too.”</p>

<p>“An’ nobody ain’ need to scawn Maggie aw’inge
flowers, either”; Susan added with calm assurance,
“’aft de church ain’ found ’um comical, an’ de
pries’ done sprinkle ’um wid holy water.”</p>

<p>Felo got up and gave the fire a vigorous poke, and
turned to the company, saying:</p>

<p>“Stop y’all preachin’ on Maggie, for Gawd sake;
an’ take yo’ tex’ from somh’n cuncernin’ we-all
color. Maggie ain’ nothin’ to we-all, no way.”</p>

<p>“You sho right, Felo,” Aunt Susan concurred.
“An’ thank you for sayin’ so.... An’ look,” she
suggested genially, “some you mens oughta go
yonder in de shed an’ fetch me a few sticks o’ wood
for dis fire, befo’ it git too low.”</p>

<p>Gussie and Felo left the room to get the wood.
Susan began pottering about the hearth. Nat fixed
a pipe of tobacco, lighted it, and gave it to Tom;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
then fixed one for himself and sat down and began
smoking. Uncle Foteen was nodding in his chair by
the fireside. Dink began playing softly on the comb,
the women humming pleasantly with him, the soothing
melody of “Po’ Moanuh got a Home at Las’.”
Before long, the wave of discord had passed on, and
the room became pervaded with a flood of harmony;
the potent spell of music lifting their emotional
natures to a sense of quiet, singing ecstasy and
spiritual introspection. Felo and Gussie came in
with several sticks of wood, and before putting
them down, stood listening attentively.</p>

<p>“Lay ’um down easy, an’ leave Unc’ Foteen sleep.”
Susan told them in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>“Y’all peaceful an’ nice now,” Felo remarked, “but
you sho goin’ have noise up in hyuh w’en de circus
come. Yonder Lizzie Cole an’ Chester Frackshun
comin’ outside. So you better make up yo’ min’ to
lissen at a loud racket w’en dey git hyuh.”</p>

<p>They took the announcement indifferently, and
continued to sing until the new arrivals appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter13">Lizzie Cole was a
buxom, merry-faced, happy-go-lucky young colored
woman; always eager for some new humorous
adventure; and fully enamoured of the thought that
“time goes merry when the heart is young.” Likewise,
equally determined to keep her thought from
anticipating the time when the heart grows old.</p>

</div>

<p>Although the daughter of a genteel, respected
Baptist minister, Lizzie gave no evidence of possessing
a single trait resembling dignity, discretion,
docility, or any other element reflecting the reputed
influence of the holy church, or the divinity of mortal
man.</p>

<p>She earned her livelihood as a maid of any task,
wherever chance might lead her. And however
onerous the duties imposed upon her, she seldom
failed to transliterate into vocal records of lasting
mirth the nature of any experience.</p>

<p>Chester Frackshun was a tall, gaunt, pecan-faced
young man; with a high-pitched voice and mincing
manners. By a strange whim of inconsistent Fate,
Lizzie was endowed with every masculine characteristic
that Chester lacked; and Chester possessed
many of the feminine traits that Lizzie could never
hope to assume. These discrepancies, it would seem,
welded the unusual bond of friendship existing between
them. Chester depended on Lizzie with a
feeling of childish trust; knowing that she would
champion his weakness and timidity. And Lizzie
was devoted to him because he relied on her protection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and because he amused her, and understood
her humor as well.</p>

<p>Chester usually worked as cook on the passenger
boats running across Lake Pontchartrain, up the
Amite river, from New Orleans to the French
Settlement. Lizzie had made a number of trips with
him, working as chambermaid, getting small pay
but having a “good time an’ plenny fun laughin’
at de Cajuns.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Chester would take a position as cook
with a large family in the city; and frequently
managed to have Lizzie with him, doing odd jobs
and making the time pass merrily while it lasted.
They shared many humorous experiences, and their
retelling of them was always a feature of any
gathering where they happened to be present.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter14">Lizzie was dressed in
a severely plain gray woolen dress, the tight-fitting
basque spanning her uncorseted luxuriance like
a huge bandage about to give way under the pressure.
Her head was bare, and her hair arranged
in innumerable little plaits wound with shoestrings.
Chester wore a stiff-bosomed pink shirt, with a
celluloid collar; an ill-fitting piqué vest, frayed and
yellow with age; and a purple cravat decorated
with a splendid blue glass ball, which declared itself
a lady’s hatpin rescued to serve a more eccentric
purpose. His clothes were of a light blue shade;
and his shoes, orange yellow.</p>

</div>

<p>As they came into the room, Lizzie began singing
lustily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell your mother to hold her tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She had a feller w’en she was young....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Stopping abruptly, she called out:</p>

<p>“Hi! good cittazun niggers. W’at y’all doin’ up in
hyuh? How you do, Aun’ Susan? Hi! old compair
Tom. Good evenin’ evvybody.—An’ you too, ole
roustabout Gussie.”</p>

<p>Chester stood silent, grinning and bowing to everybody.</p>

<p>“Gal, stop yo’ racket,” Susan said, going over to
her and speaking quietly. “Don’t you see somebody
sleepin’? W’at ailin’ you? You bin had somh’n to
drink comin’ ’long de road?”</p>

<p>“Who?” Lizzie echoed, unmindful of Susan’s admonition.
“Lizzie ain’ seen nothin’ but gutter water
’long de road, Sis’ Susan; an’ you know Lizzie too
well-raise’ to tackle dat.”</p>

<p>“Chester, how you do?” Scilla coquetted, trying to
embarrass him. “You sho look sweet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“Chester do alright w’en he let alone,” Lizzie answered
quickly. “But de boy bin complainin’ he
delicate an’ healt’y, an’ you know we comed a long
way to make visit wid y’all dis evenin’; an’ we kind
o’ dry roun’ de th’oat. An’ Sis’ Susan you could’n’
len’ Chester a bucket an’ leave him go yonder to
Mr. Camille sto’ an’ git some col’ stimmalashun,
so we kin drink to each-another healt’; could
you?”</p>

<p>“You ain’ on no steamboat ’munks deck-hans, Lizzie,”
Susan replied with sharp sarcasm. “An’ you
know good I ain’ ’low no drinkin’ up in my house,
either.”</p>

<p>“O ’scuse me, Miss Smiley,” Lizzie apologized, affecting
a grandiloquent air. “I sho did forgot you
was sanctify.”</p>

<p>Tom moved impatiently in his chair, saying:</p>

<p>“Gal, set down, an’ drink some coffee, an’ stop yo’
dev’lish ramblin’.”</p>

<p>“Coffee ain’ sattafyin’ to de stummic, Mr. Tom”;
Chester’s mild falsetto made timely comment,
“’specially w’en you bin used to lickers mo’ nur’-shin’....
You goin’ drink coffee, Lizzie?” He
asked her wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Boy, set down, an’ don’ show people how ignun
you is,” Lizzie answered, scowling playfully and
pretending to be greatly annoyed. “Don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
know ’tain manners an’ behayviah to scawn de
of’rins o’ de house?... Bow yo’ head an’ tip yo’
hat to Miss Smiley coffee. An’ w’en we git yonder
to Gritny, den you kin say thang Gawd to dat cup
o’ limmon gin in Mr. Cholly Groos bar-room.”</p>

<p>Chester sat down obediently, everybody laughing
heartily at the amusing by-play.</p>

<p>Going over to the fire, Lizzie sat down on the floor
near Tom’s chair; took off her shoes and spread out
her feet to warm them before the pleasant blaze. As
she settled into a comfortable position, she heard
several grunts of surprise from the women. Gazing
at the fire, she said with delightful unconcern:</p>

<p>“I know I’m simple; but I sho likes to make myself
at home, whah-ever I goes.... An’ dese pair o’
feets Lizzie got, cert’ny is tired; all de walkin’ me
an’ Chester bin doin’ yistiddy an’ today.”</p>

<p>“W’at walkin’ you an’ Chester got to do?...
You ain’ workin’?” Came the chorus of inquiry.</p>

<p>“Workin’?” Lizzie echoed, looking around from one
to the other. “I know I ain’ bin play’n.... An’
dem nasty heroes sho ain’ goin’ think Lizzie play’n,
if ever I ketch up wid ’um close enough to lay my
han’s on ’um, an’ leave my passion run reckless....
Who?... Dey sho will call it workin’,
w’en Lizzie commence workin’ on ’um.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“Chester, w’at ail Lizzie?” Gussie asked. “She talkin’
out her right min’, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie got her good sense,” Chester answered.
“She know w’at she sayin’. An’ she ain’ fraid to tell
you, if you wan’ know.”</p>

<p>Acting as spokesman for the assembly, Nat said:</p>

<p>“Be still, evvybody.... Now go ’head, gal, an’
speak yo’ testament.”</p>

<p>Lizzie inquired cautiously:</p>

<p>“But how many settin’ in dis room goin’ be witness
Lizzie done right if dey go to put Lizzie in jail?”</p>

<p>“Great-day-in-de-mawnin’!” Nat exclaimed. “You
ain’ kilt nobody, is you?”</p>

<p>“I ain’ mean to kill nobody, Unc’ Nat,” she assured
him. “All Lizzie wan’ do, is wreck de nasty heroes
so dey own fam’ly won’ recanize ’um; da’s all.”</p>

<p>“Gal, stop makin’ riddles, an’ talk plain, for Gawd
sake,” Susan said, impatient to learn the scandal.
“Who you talkin’ ’bout, any way?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t y’all hyeah’d w’at dey done to Chester las’
Saddy night, w’en he was comin’ home from ole
Aun’ Critty Briscoe wake, yonder to my Pa
church?”</p>

<p>“Who?... Done w’at?... Tell it.” They prevailed
upon her with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>“Ain’ found out yet,” Lizzie informed them, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
growing enthusiasm. “But Gawd ain’ goin’ leave
me miss ’um. Da’s de main reason I’m goin’ to
church wid Chester tonight w’en we leave hyuh.... So
I kin follow behin’ an’ lay ’um out, if dey
start any humbug like las’ week.”</p>

<p>“But you ain’ tol’ yet anything ’bout w’at dey
did,” Gussie said to her casually.</p>

<p>Somewhat indifferently she remarked:</p>

<p>“Some y’all kin laugh, if you like, ’bout w’at dey
done to Chester.” Then with a look of suspicion
towards Gussie: “An’ some yuther ones better
think on w’at dey hyeah me tell I’m goin’ do, if I
ketch ’um dead to rights.”</p>

<p>Frowning sullenly, Gussie asked her:</p>

<p>“W’at make you gotta look at me so crittacul? I
bin had any traffic wid Chester, you wan’ th’ow
suspicion on me ’bout w’at was did to ’im?”</p>

<p>“Chester,” Lizzie called to him peremptorily, “ain’t
you said you could see in de moonlight plain, dey
was’n all dark-skin mens w’at meddled you an’
pulled off yo’ clo’se, an’ sont you runnin’ thoo de
street wid nothin’ on but yo’ undershirt?”</p>

<p>“Sho did,” Chester answered firmly. “Dey had one
de mens sho did look bright-skin to me.”</p>

<p>“Whah all dis thing took place?” Felo asked, laughing.</p>

<p>“Right down on de Morgan railroad, jes befo’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
you git to de pastur,” Chester answered. “I was
goin’ along, singin’ to myself; ain’ stud’in ’bout
nobody; w’en all at once, three or fo’ mens spring
out de bushes, an’ say to me: ‘Pull off dat lady
undershirt you got on, ole Betsy!’ ... An’ befo’
I had time to cunsider w’at was goin’ happen, dey
had grab hold o’ me, an’ pulled off my clo’se befo’
I knowed it.</p>

<p>“I commence strug’lin’ wid ’um to git loose; an’ I
bit at ’um an’ hollered so loud, till dey had to lemme
go. Den I broke out runnin’, an’ ain’ stop till I
got home.... An’ ain’ had a Gawd’s blessed piece
o’ clo’se on but a thin undershirt.”</p>

<p>“A lady undershirt?” Carmelite asked, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“W’at business you got to know?” Lizzie demanded,
speaking with growing excitement. “It
make any diffunce to anybody if Chester feel like
he wan’ put on a lady undershirt? Dat ain’ give
people no right to meddle Chester on de high road,
an’ ’zamine his body to see w’at kind o’ und’-clo’se
de boy got on.... But wait till Lizzie ketch up
wid ’um! Jes’ wait.... Y’all <i>sho</i> goin’ see how
Lizzie goin’ ’zamine de nasty Hellians, once she
got her two han’s on ’um! Who?... None y’all
ain’ never seen Lizzie Cole w’en her passion done
struck her powerful!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Cha-cha-cha, Lizzie,” Susan said contemptuously,
“stop yo’ tongue from runnin’ so fas’. You know
guinea-hens kin make a loud racket w’en dey be in
de weeds, off to dey-self.”</p>

<p>“Who? Aun’ Susan,” she answered quickly, “You
ain’ think Lizzie talkin’ random to make y’all
laugh, is you? You know I ain’ never bin had no
chillun, an’ all my strank is my own.... An’ I
promise my Gawd to sho do my bes’ an’ a li’l mo’,
w’en de time come for me to take my sattafaction.”</p>

<p>Squinting his eyes humorously, Nat asked:</p>

<p>“You mus’ be think’ you Goliah, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Strank ain’ de onlies’ thing Lizzie countin’ on,
Unc’ Nat,” she assured him. “You know it don’
take no time to stick a needle in somebody nabel
w’en you wan’ do ’way wid ’um.”</p>

<p>This statement was greeted with general laughter,
during which Lizzie’s expression was one of serious
amazement. As soon as their laughter and playful
comment subsided, she continued:</p>

<p>“I ain’ makin’ up nothin’ out my ’maginashun.
W’at I’m say’n is natchal fac’s. You pass a needle
thoo somebody nabel, an’ tain nobody but <i>Gawd</i>
kin tell w’at dey died from.”</p>

<p>“An’ you expec’ we-all to b’lieve a tale like dat?”
Felo asked with disdain.</p>

<p>“Y’all know how Unc’ Peesah died sudden las’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
New Yeahs,” Chester announced solemnly. “But
you ain’ never hyeah’d w’at kilt ’im, is you?”</p>

<p>“Colic; so dey tell me”; Soongy answered, “from
eatin’ too much buttermilk an’ cucumber sallit befo’
he went to bed.”</p>

<p>“Whah Unc’ Peesah could git cucumbers in Jannawerry?”
Nat demanded. “Don’t you re’lize w’at
you say’n ain’ sinetiffic?”</p>

<p>“You sho right, Unc’ Nat,” Chester concurred.
“Colic ain’ had a thing to do wid it. ’Twas a fatal
needle sont Unc’ Peesah ’way from hyuh. An’ nobody
don’ know it better’n me.”</p>

<p>“Lawd, Chester!” Nookie exclaimed in surprise.
“W’at hidden myst’ry dis is you done got mixed up
in? Lemme hyeah you tell ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“Chester,” Lizzie called to him abruptly, “pass yo’
han’ ’cross yo’ mouf an’ wipe it dry.... You
know, dey got mo’ ways o’ spreadin’ de news besides
puttin’ it in de newspaper.... Wipe yo’
mouf, boy, an’ say no mo’.”</p>

<p>For a few moments there was a general silence, all
eyes fixed upon Chester expectantly. Presently
Gussie spoke:</p>

<p>“Lizzie, w’at make you wan’ control Chester an’
keep de boy from talkin’?”</p>

<p>“’Cause talkin’ is ketchin’,” Lizzie answered. “An’
some people got a reckless way o’ speakin’ dey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
words twice an’ makin’ ’um diffunt. So you gotta
watch out an’ keep from tellin’ too much. An’ any
way, de boy done wiped his lips; an’ me an’ Chester
jus’ ’bout ready to fix we-all mouf for some o’
Sis’ Susan gumbo, befo’ we start out for church,
yonder to Gritny.”</p>

<p>Getting up from the floor, she shook herself like
a hen emerging from a dust bath, kicked her shoes
aside, and called out with energy:</p>

<p>“Come on, Sis’ Smiley, lemme help you fix de
plates. Dey got two hongry niggers hyuh kin outeat
a mul’tude o’ Izzalites.” Then looking at Chester,
she said to him boisterously: “Boy, drap yo’
ole long self over to dis side de table an’ try’n’
look like you got a intrus’ in de things goin’ on!... You
ain’ never heah’d tell ’bout gumbo
befo’?”</p>

<p>Chester simpered good-naturedly and took a seat
at the table. When the gumbo was served, Lizzie
sat down alongside of him and they began eating.
Dink’s whimpering music was heard over in the
corner of the room, waking like a timely invitation,
and several members began humming softly.</p>

<p>Gussie, eager for conversation, was about to speak;
when Nat, preferring to have no irrelevant distraction,
held up his hands for silence, rolling his eyes
ominously. Gussie obeyed the sign, and the humming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
flowed on uninterrupted. By degrees it gathered
volume, sustained and fervent; every one surrendering
unconsciously to the ingratiating lilt of
the pulsing melody.</p>

<p>Tom sat humming with his hands to his head, his
elbows resting on his knees. Susan was sitting opposite,
swaying to and fro in rhythmic contemplation.
Nat sat upright with his head resting against
the back of his chair, his brawny hands clasping the
chair legs. Uncle Foteen sat with his eyes closed,
every now and then intoning a low “A-men.” The
women accentuated the rhythm as they hummed,
with a gentle patting of the feet. And Felo’s
spasmodic interpolation of a picturesque word or
a fragmentary line from the song proper, added
rare charm to the fleeting tuneful moments.</p>

<p>Lizzie and Chester were eating with evident enjoyment,
apparently interested in the obligato of
voices. Having finished her gumbo, Lizzie leaned
back in her chair, and in a spirit of careless mischief
began singing lustily the old street song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mama got a baby called “Ti-nah-nah-’nah</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Ti-nah-nah ’nah, ’nah....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Felo’s loud reprimand brought her song to an
abrupt close. Glowering with indignation, he called
to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Gal, git out o’ hyuh wid yo’ strumpet ways!
W’at you take dis place to be, anyhow? You better
go out yonder on de road, an’ play wid yo’ kind, if
you can’ ack right w’en you git ’munks people w’at
know how to be decen’.”</p>

<p>“But no, Mr. Felo,” Lizzie answered with genuine
surprise. “You ain’ mean to call me out my name
like dat, is you?”</p>

<p>“W’at you is, if you ain’ a strumpet?” Felo asked
with vehemence. “I ain’ hesitate to call you a <i>double</i>
strumpet; reckless as you is;—on-cuncernin’ of
you bein’ a preacher daughter, an’ plenny ole
enough to know better.”</p>

<p>Foreseeing an altercation, Susan interposed.</p>

<p>“Look!” She called to Lizzie. “Ain’t you say you
an’ Chester was goin’ to church yonder to
Gritny?”</p>

<p>Lizzie looked at Susan without replying. Going
over to her, Susan took her by the arm, saying:</p>

<p>“If you <i>is</i> goin’, den y’all two better start befo’ it
git too late.” Then turning to Felo, she said: “Felo,
go yonder in de side yard an’ fetch me a pitcher o’
cistun water.”</p>

<p>As Felo left the room, Lizzie muttered:</p>

<p>“Good thing I ain’ let my tongue cut loose an’ say
evvything my min’ tol’ me to say to dat ole rusty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
w’ite-folks nigger.... It mus’ bin Gawd tol’ you
sen’ him out de room. Sis’ Susan.”</p>

<p>Shaking her head and smiling pleasantly, Susan
said:</p>

<p>“An’ Gawd expec’in you to go ’way from hyuh befo’
Felo git back. So don’ was’e time talkin’, but go
’long ... Chester, yonder yo’ hat. Take Lizzie
wid you to de New Hope church an’ see ’f you can’
make her pray. Go ’long, now, bofe of you; an’ no
hard feelin’s.”</p>

<p>Fully aware of Susan’s positive character, and
feeling convinced that further argument was useless,
Lizzie made ready to leave with silent magnanimity.
She walked over to the fireplace proudly,
saying with a haughty air:</p>

<p>“Chester, pay Miss Smiley de change comin’ to
her, till I put on my shoes.”</p>

<p>Chester settled the account, and they walked towards
the front door.</p>

<p>“Good-night to y’all fellow-Chrishtuns,” Lizzie
said with spurious geniality. “An’ much oblige’ for
yo’ manners an’ behavior.”</p>

<p>Just as she finished her lofty farewell, Felo came
in from the back room.</p>

<p>“Da’s right, Lizzie”; he said to her, “don’ go ’way
from hyuh wid yo’ feelin’s upset ’bout somh’n<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
was said to you. Good-night to you; an’ Gawd go
wid you.”</p>

<p>“Go to Hell!” She told him; pushing Chester
through the open door and slamming it after her.</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter15">The road which Lizzie
and Chester had to take from Susan’s cook shop
down to church in the village, was a lonely, desolate
stretch of about two miles. The few homes along
the river front were poor, depleted reminders of old
plantation days, few and far between, and setting
far back from the road. If one took the railroad
track running parallel with the high levee, unless
the moon was shining, there was no other light to
show the way but the clear glimmer of the stars;
provided there was no mist in the sky or dripping
fog creeping along the land. If one took the path on
the top of the levee, the reflection from the electric
lights on the New Orleans’ side of the river helped
to point out the puddles and uneven places, and the
vagrant cows that selected the grassy prominence
for their somnolent ruminating.</p>

</div>

<p>After a while one came to the cotton seed oil mills
with their spreading wharves built over the water,
and the numerous electric lights and occasional patrolling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
nightwatchman offered a certain sense of
protection. But it was not until one had passed
through the long aisles of cotton seed in sacks, and
bales of lint piled to a great height and covered with
suspicious-looking tarpaulins, from under which
imaginary ruffians might spring unawares, that a
wholesome feeling of courage came to one before
entering the village. Then, there was Mr. Cholly
Groos’s bar-room, just at the edge of the town; and
the thought of his inspiriting lemon-gin always
made one “step light an’ ready to face the devil.”</p>

<p>Having traipsed the lonely distance with little or
no conversation between them, Lizzie at length proposed
going to Mr. Cholly’s for a comforting cup
before proceeding to her father’s church at the
back of the town. Chester was agreeable and they
hurried forward, talking pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Chester, you got any money?” She asked him.</p>

<p>“W’at you wan’ know for?”</p>

<p>“Well, I jus’ wan’ know sho if you got money.
’Cause I don’ care if I get good an’ drunk tonight;
ole Felo done got me feelin’ so upset,—callin’ me
out my name like he did, yonder befo’ all dem
people.”</p>

<p>“W’at good gittin’ drunk goin’ do you?” Chester
asked reprovingly. “’Tain’ goin’ hurt Felo none,
is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Nasty, scawnful, w’ite-folks nigger,” she muttered
with deep contempt. “I ain’ goin’ leave myself
res’ till I git even wid ’im.... You watch me.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ Felo a member de New Hope church?” Chester
insinuated with artful meaning. “Felo over
hyuh evvy Sunday night; an’ dey ain’ got no under-groun’
workers kin tell you somh’n ’bout Felo
tracks?”</p>

<p>“Boy, you sho got a good head,” Lizzie answered.
“Stay wid me; an’ no matter w’at happen, ’twon’
be nobody but Chester an’ Lizzie.... W’at you
say?”</p>

<p>“Gawd grant it,” he answered. And laughing merrily,
they walked on towards the glimmering light
from the bar-room door, a welcome beacon at the
head of the street.</p>

<p>They soon reached the place, and as Lizzie entered,
followed by Chester, she called out gaily:</p>

<p>“Two big cups o’ limmon-gin, Mr. Cholly. An’ po’
’um out heavy; ’cause me an’ Chester feelin’ kind
o’ weak an’ puny dis evenin’.”</p>

<p>Across the room several men were playing cards.
Recognizing Lizzie, one of them said to her:</p>

<p>“How come you don’ stop play’n wid Chester, an’
git you a sho-nuf man w’at kin give you a good
time, an’ show you somh’n natchal befo’ ole age
come creepin’ up on you?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Lizzie stopped drinking, and glaring at him angrily,
she answered with clinched teeth:</p>

<p>“Good thing Mr. Cholly stannin’ hyuh, ole nigger.
’Cause I sho would tell you somh’n mo’ besides
‘damn yo’ nasty soul an’ go to Hell.’” After which,
she gulped the remainder of her lemon-gin and
stalked out of the room, leaving Chester to take
care of the payment.</p>

<p>She waited for him outside, and when he came to
her, they started off together. As they walked
along, the awkward silence was broken now and
then by Chester’s subdued humming. Lizzie appeared
to be occupied with some burdening
thought.</p>

<p>At last they reached the church door. The place was
quite crowded and the members were singing lustily.
Lizzie recognized the funeral hymn, which
caused her some surprise. As they entered, a young
woman named Lethe greeted them, and Lizzie
asked her:</p>

<p>“Who dead, Lethe? I ain’ know dey had any wake
to-night.”</p>

<p>“One ole lady dey calls Aun’ Milly,” Lethe informed
her. “Sis’ Amy Hollan’ Ma. Come fum
Peach Awchud, yonder to Bayou Bah-tah-yuh.”</p>

<p>“W’en de ole lady died?” Lizzie asked.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Lizzie,” she went on, “I ain’ never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
got de straight ’bout de thing. You know, Aun’
Amy bin drunk for mos’ a week, an’ nobody ain’
bin able to git de right news fum ’uh.”</p>

<p>“An’ dey bring de ole lady all de way from Peach
Awchud hyuh, to sing ove’ ’uh?” Lizzie asked, half-playfully.</p>

<p>“Lizzie, don’ ply me wid a whole lot o’ queshtun
I ain’ able to answer. All I know, I’m goin’ tell you,
if you wan’ lissen.”</p>

<p>“Come set hyuh an’ talk ’bout it,” Chester suggested,
leading them to a bench in the corner and
sitting down. “Now, go ’head.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know,” Lethe began again, “me an’ my
brether Booguloo took a skiff soon dis mawnin’, an’
went down Harvey Cunnal to see my cousin
Dootsy, cookin’ yonder at de camp for dem mens
pickin’ moss to Li’l Coquille bayou.”</p>

<p>“How much a pound dey gits for black moss,
Lethe?” inquired Chester, interrupting her story.</p>

<p>“Boy, shet yo’ mouf!” Lizzie commanded sharply.
“Lethe ain’ talkin’ ’bout sellin’ no moss. She
talkin’ ’bout de ole lady call Aun’ Milly,—layin’
yonder ’ceasded. (Deceased.) Don’t you hyeah ’um
singin’ ove’ ’uh? Shet up, an’ lissen.”</p>

<p>Seeing Chester offer no argument to Lizzie’s rebuke,
Lethe resumed her story.</p>

<p>“Well, like I was goin’ say: me an’ Booguloo was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
helpin’ my cousin Dootsy spread de green moss in
de sun to dry on de bushes growin’ on de side de
cunnal bank; w’en w’at we seen comin’ roun’ de
ben’ up de cunnal, but a skiff cov’ud over wid a
muskeeter-bar up on cane reed poles, lookin’ like
a natchal bed floatin’ on de water; an’ wavin’ up
an’ down,—shinin’ in de sun like a cream-color
flag.</p>

<p>“Booguloo say: ‘But w’at dis thing is?... Somebody
ain’ use’ to muskeeters, an’ gotta ride in big
daylight, settin’ up und’ a muskeeter net?...
Dis ain’ no cheap people. Dis mus’ be qual’ty
folks.’</p>

<p>“I say: Maybe somebody sick, an’ dey bin took ’um
to de doctor, yonder to Gritny. You know muskeeter-bite
bad for de fever; so maybe da’s w’at
make dey put up de muskeeter net.</p>

<p>“Bime-by de skiff come a li’l closer, an’ we seen dey
had a ole cullud man pullin’; an’ a big fat dark-skin
ooman settin’ on de back seat.</p>

<p>“I say: Booguloo, ain’ da’s Aun’ Amy Hollan
settin’ up in de skiff?</p>

<p>“Booguloo give a good look, an’ he say: ‘Sho is,
Lethe. Da’s Aun’ Amy own-self. An’ I bet she
drunk as a policeman on Mahdi Gras day!’</p>

<p>“An’ Booguloo was right, too. ’Cause w’en de skiff
come close enough for us to call to Aun’ Amy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
she look like somebody simple; an’ she could hardly
talk.</p>

<p>“I say: Aun’ Amy, you mus’ bin heard de muskeeters
was bad out hyuh soon in de mawnin’, ain’t
you?</p>

<p>“She look at me like somebody jus’ woke up, an’
she say: ‘Da’s w’at de tell me.’ Talkin’ slow, like
her tongue mos’ pah’lize.</p>

<p>“Booguloo say. ‘Aun’ Amy, whah you goin’ so
soon in de mawnin’?’</p>

<p>“She say: ‘To fetch my Ma; yonder to Peach Awchud.’</p>

<p>“I say: Aun’ Amy, she ain’ sick, is she?</p>

<p>“She say: ‘Da’s w’at dey tell me.’</p>

<p>“Booguloo say: ‘She ain’ dead, is she?’</p>

<p>“Aun’ Amy say: ‘Da’s w’at dey tell me.’</p>

<p>“I say: W’en she died, yistiddy?</p>

<p>“She say: Da’s w’at dey tell me.’</p>

<p>“I say: An’ dey goin’ take ’uh all de way to Gritny
to wake ’uh, an’ have de berrin’?</p>

<p>“She say: ‘Da’s w’at dey tell me.’</p>

<p>“Booguloo say: ‘Look Mister; go ’head wid yo’
skiff. Hurry up an’ pull Aun’ Amy yonder to
Peach Awchud, an’ leave ’uh learn somh’n mo’ concernin’
w’at dey goin’ do wid ’uh Ma. ’Cause she
ain’ look like she know <i>nothin’</i> ’bout de po’ ole soul.’</p>

<p>“So dah whah de skiff went on down de bayou. An’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
I ain’ know nothin’ futher, till I got hyuh to de
church dis evenin’, an’ foun’ all de members singin’
ove’ Aun’ Milly.”</p>

<p>The amusing recital furnished Lizzie with keen
enjoyment and she was laughing heartily. When
Lethe had finished, Chester asked her:</p>

<p>“But how dey got de ole lady way from Peach
Awchud so quick? Peach Awchud mo’n eighteen
miles down the bayou. How dey brought ’uh
up?”</p>

<p>“Dey fetched ’uh up in de skiff, rolled up in a
blanket; wid Aun’ Amy settin’ on de back seat und’
de muskeeter net, speechless drunk, like she was
w’en me an’ Booguloo seen ’uh dis mawnin’. An’ ’uh
oldes’ daughter, Frozine, was waitin’ at de head o’
de cunnal wid Mr. Antoine groc’ry wagon; an’ dey
brung ’uh straight hyuh to de church ’bout two
hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Whah dey lef’ Aim’ Amy?” Lizzie asked.</p>

<p>“She settin’ up yonder on de front row, pah’lize
drunk, try’n to sing. An’ nobody can’ get de po’
soul to budge.”</p>

<p>“Aun’ Amy mus’ be got a flas’ hide somewhah
in ’uh pocket,” ventured Chester. “She still drunk
from soon dis mawnin’ till now.”</p>

<p>“Mus’ be,” agreed Lethe. “Sis’ Fanny an’ Frozine
bin try’n to git Aun’ Amy home to ’uh house, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
drink some strong coffee, but she keep on say’n,
talkin’ like somebody goin’ sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">An’ I’m jew to stay hyuh wid ’uh an’ sing.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Den w’en Frozine try to coax ’uh home, she say,
jes’ like she singin’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Aun’ Milly was gone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Sis’ Fanny keep on say’n to ’uh: ‘Da’s alright, Sis’
Amy; yo’ Ma ain’ goin’ be lef’ alone. Come go home
wid me, an’ drink some strong coffee to bring yo’
strank back, an’ you goin’ feel better.’”</p>

<p>“But Aun’ Amy say:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">An’ sing Aun’ Milly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A long farewell.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It soun’ like it oughta be pitiful,” said Lizzie, with
a light laugh. “But it sho goin’ start me gig’lin’,
if I go in yonder whah Aun’ Amy settin’, an’ lissen
at w’at she say’n. So set hyuh wid me, Lethe, an’
leave us talk till we feels like joinin’ wid de
singin’.”</p>

<p>Chester got up to go. “Well, y’all kin set hyuh long
as you please,” he said, “but I’m goin’ up yonder
in front to view Aun’ Amy an’ watch w’at goin’ on.
Look for me, Lizzie, w’en you git ready to go.”</p>

<p>Left to themselves, now came the time for comment
and confidences. Lethe was a notorious gossip, and
Lizzie, being an omnivorous listener, there was little
need to fear a moment of monotony during the
time they were together. Not a member present escaped
criticism or ridicule; Lizzie’s keen enjoyment
helping to encourage Lethe’s loquacious humor.
And when her knowledge of the doings and sayings
of her colored friends was exhausted, she was able
to recount any number of ludicrous stories about
“de w’ite-folks”; irrespective of their station;
whether they were “nothin’ but parties an’ parties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
wid no fam’ly o’ people,” or “p’yo w’ite-folks wid
high-up connection.”</p>

<p>Desiring a share of the honor of entertaining, Lizzie
told some of her amusing adventures on the
steamboat when along with Chester; of her visit
to Susan’s cook shop that evening, and her unpleasant
encounter with Felo; which account she embroidered
elaborately for the better satisfaction of
the amazed Lethe, whom she soon discovered to be
Felo’s particular friend.</p>

<p>“An’ you say you lef’ Felo yonder to Susan cook
shop?” Lethe asked with curious interest.</p>

<p>“Lef’ him yonder eatin’ an’ drinkin’, wid Scilla an’
Soongy an’ Carm’lite an’ Nookie, an’ Unc’ Nat
an’ some yuther mens,” Lizzie informed her. “An’
maybe dey got a heap mo’ wimmins by now, ’cause
you know I’m bin gone from yonder a good
w’ile.”</p>

<p>This was unwelcome news to Lethe. Her forehead
settled into a deep frown, and gazing into space,
she thought aloud:</p>

<p>“An’ de ole smooth-tongue hypocrite goin’ come
home long aft’ hours tonight, w’en I be in bed, an’
goin’ say he jus’ come from Mr. Amos house, ’cross
de river.... But wait;—I’m goin’ fix him dis
blessed night o’ my Lawd, sho as I’m bawn.”</p>

<p>Looking at her in wonderment, Lizzie asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“W’at you mean, Lethe? You goin’ to Sis’ Fanny
house an’ wait till Felo come home?”</p>

<p>“Wa’t you think goin’ take me to Sis’ Fanny house,
w’en I got a good house o’ my own?” she returned,
with a show of impatience.</p>

<p>“Den how you goin’ see Felo aft’ you done gone to
bed?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, ain’t you know Felo bin stay’n wid me to
my house evvy Sunday night for a long time? You
ain’ think Felo come all de way clean ’cross de
river jes’ to go to de New Hope church, is you?”</p>

<p>“I know he all time braggin’ ’bout bein’ a good
Chrishtun,” Lizize said, with cautious innocence.
“But I ain’ never heayh’d ’im bring yo’ name in de
queshtun no time.”</p>

<p>Lethe’s mind was busy chasing after her wandering
thoughts. “So da’s w’at make him come late all
de time,” she ruminated. “Goin’ yonder to Susan
cook shop. Den comin’ hyuh wid a lie in ’is mouf,
’bout Mr. Amos keepin’ ’im late.”</p>

<p>“Mens is mens, Lethe,” Lizzie consoled her. “An’
you think Felo gotta be diffunt from de res’ dese
niggers, jes’ because he bin livin’ to Mr. Amos
house so long an’ know somh’n ’bout w’ite-folks
ways?.... Who? It sho goin’ take a better man
den ole ’ceitful Felo to keep me from havin’ my
pleasure, w’en de worl’ so big an’ handy to play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
’roun’ in.... Git up from hyuh, Lethe; an’ rub
dem wrinkles out yo’ face, an’ leave us go up yonder
an’ sing ove’ Aun’ Milly.... Come on. Dey done
start “Po’ Li’l Jesus,” an’ ’twon’ be long befo’ de
whole buildin’ be rockin’.... Come on, lessus
go.”</p>

<p>Lethe looked at her dejectedly. “Go ’head, an’ sing
much as you please,” she said, “I’m goin’ home.”</p>

<p>And as Lizzie left her, she walked out.</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter16">However inconsistent
Felo’s ideas of theology might appear, there were
three important purposes he endeavored to live up
to with a sincerity that became him nobly. Three
purposes he took great pleasure in making known
at all times: “To hol’ a high head an’ keep a good
name ’munks de cullud folks”; “to stick close to
Mr. Amos, and look aft’ his welfare long’s he staid
single”; and, “to hol’ cov’nan wid Gawd an’ serve
Jesus long as I got my good sense.”</p>

</div>

<p>The first of these, interpreted by many of his unsympathetic
friends as a sort of unseemly arrogance,
which they called his “biggidy ways,” won
for him the name of “w’ite-folks nigger.” While the
second brought him the assurance of a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
home, and fixed his standing as a member of the
household, a sort of heir by annexation;—“joint
arran’ de fam’ly,” as he called it. As he and Mr.
Amos had been playmates from early childhood,
his connection in reality was more like that of a
faithful friend, than the position of a common servant
without rights and privileges. And to keep
faith with Mr. Amos and hold his confidence and
lasting respect, was next to keeping his covenant
with God.</p>

<p>When he came back to work the day after his visit
to Susan’s cook shop, he was conscious of something
having happened which might shake this feeling
of trust; and the burdening thought troubled
him sorely. Try as he would, he was unable to free
himself of the haunting fact or invent a reasonable
excuse to explain his somber mood, which he was
certain would not escape Mr. Amos’s attention.
Song, at all times an easy means for expressing
the gladness or turbulence of his emotional soul,
now deserted him completely. And when he tried
to pray, his mind went groping about in a wilderness
of mist and fog, unable to find a word or
thought that would bring him any spiritual relief.</p>

<p>To elude Mr. Amos was out of the question; because
it was an understood custom, that Felo must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
sit across the room and talk while Mr. Amos ate;
giving a detailed account of his week-end trip across
the river, with the doings and sayings of his colored
friends, most of whom Mr. Amos knew from early
childhood. It was always a delightful conference,
and Mr. Amos encouraged it with genuine interest.</p>

<p>A quiet evening spent at home alone with Felo,
he declared, was sure to be an evening of picturesque
thought and spontaneous, refreshing entertainment.
Because humble Felo had more to offer
in the way of colorful, living literature, than one
could ever expect to find at the colorless teas and
elaborate dinner parties of many pseudo-literary
white friends.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter17">As Mr. Amos sat down to
eat, Felo took his accustomed chair on the opposite
side of the room near the door leading to the kitchen,
where he would be in readiness during the
progress of the meal. He sat quietly, his gaze fixed
on the floor rug, staring into infinitude; his arms
hanging aimlessly by the sides of his chair.</p>

</div>

<p>In the center of the table was a shallow dark green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
bowl filled with dainty, pink wild mimosa blossoms;
the unusual color combination together with the
acquisition of the rare little flowers, causing Mr.
Amos to wonder in silent admiration. After a while
he said to Felo:</p>

<p>“Were did you get the lovely ‘touch-me-nots,’ so
late in the season?”</p>

<p>“Yonder in Gritny,” came the reply; slow and apathetic.</p>

<p>“From your mother’s garden?”</p>

<p>“Ma ain’ got no time to play wid no garden; wid all
dem chillun an’ dat hog she got to look to.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you bought them?” Mr. Amos
persisted.</p>

<p>“Who goin’ buy tetch-me-not flow’rs, w’en dey got
’um growin’ wil’ like grass, all up an’ down de railroad
track?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Amos, “wherever they came from,
they’re very lovely; and I suppose I must thank
you for bringing them to me.”</p>

<p>Felo made no reply, but sat looking at the floor
vacantly. His silence was unusual and Mr. Amos
wondered at it. Felo was always ready for conversation.
Was there anything the matter, Mr. Amos
asked him.</p>

<p>After a slight hesitation, he answered in a subdued
tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Man, eat yo’ li’l foods, an’ don’ worry ’bout
me.”</p>

<p>Wondering at the polite indifference, Mr. Amos
asked:</p>

<p>“What ails you, Felo, are you ill?”</p>

<p>Folding his arms slowly, he leaned forward on his
knees and looked away from Mr. Amos as he
spoke:</p>

<p>“Man, eat yo’ foods, for Gawd sake; an’ don’ ask
so many inquis’tun queshtun. Git thoo so I kin
wash dese dishes an’ go yonder to my room.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you tonight?” Mr. Amos
asked with a show of impatience. “Are you sick?
Are you tired? Anything the matter at home?”</p>

<p>“Man, don’ plague me,” he answered appealingly.
“Be still an’ don’ worry me. Do I look like anybody
sick?”</p>

<p>“You look about as healthy as somebody dead and
buried,” Mr. Amos answered, smiling playfully.
“What happened to you that you look so forlorn
and friendless?”</p>

<p>Attempting a bravado manner, he said:</p>

<p>“Nobody but de devil sont you hyuh to plague
me tonight. My feelin’s is my feelin’s; an’ nothin’
ain’ goin’ change ’um. So ’tain no use talkin’ an’
try’n tell w’at make ’um so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“Alright, deacon,” Mr. Amos answered, with an
air of feigned indifference. “If you think there’s
nothing I can do to help you smooth out the kinks,
whatever they are, so be it.”</p>

<p>Felo remained silent until Mr. Amos was about to
leave the room. Seeing him start towards the stairway,
he asked:</p>

<p>“You ain’ goin’ out tonight, is you?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Well, y’oughta stay home some time an’ git yo’
night-res’.... All time runnin’ out in de night
air an’ fros’, exposin’ yo’self like you does; wid de
win’ searchin’ ’roun yo’ ankles an’ things, an’
blowin’ ’cross yo’ body an’ keep you lookin’ so
puny.”</p>

<p>“How about yourself?” Mr. Amos asked him. “You
don’t seem to be concerned about the night air and
the wind when you go rambling about? I suppose
being a deacon of the church, you have some special
arrangement with God to temper the elements to
your convenience?”</p>

<p>“Look. Leave dat be jes’ like it is,” he said abruptly,
“I’m thinkin’ ’bout who got to look aft’ you w’en
you git flat o’ yo’ back an’ can’ help yo’self no mo’.
’Tain nobody but Felo got to be plague’ wid you.
Da’s de one thing make me cuncern yonder wid de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
future.... But de main thing I ax you,—befo’
you commence all dis heavy comasation,—is you
goin’ out tonight?”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, w’en I git thoo in de kitchen, I wan’ talk wid
you confidenshun.”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos laughed good-naturedly, saying to
him:</p>

<p>“I’ll be upstairs, ready to listen to your tale of rape
or robbery, whichever it might be. But come with a
different face than the one you wear now. I don’t
want to have bad dreams tonight.”</p>

<p>With a heroic attempt to smile, he answered, as Mr.
Amos walked away:</p>

<p>“Go ’head upstairs, for Gawd sake. You all time
ready to play too much.”</p>

<p>After finishing all his chores in the kitchen, Felo
went through the house, seeing that all the windows
and doors were fastened, before he went upstairs.
Going into the room where Mr. Amos was, he
found him lying on the bed reading, with the cat
asleep on his chest. The cat, like Mr. Amos, was one
of Felo’s constant worries. He didn’t know which
one of them was “de wusser.” It was a splendid
excuse for him to expostulate.</p>

<p>“Y’awter put dat ole cat out-doahs. All two of
you keep dis place lookin’ like a fatal rabbit-nes’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
de way yo’ hair be fallin’ ove’ evvything. I kin
shake dem blankets till my two arms be stiff, an’ de
hair yet hanging’ to ’um. An’ de onles way to git
y’all hair off des flo’-rugs,—I gotta git down on
my knees an’ brush ’um wid a swiss-broom.”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos put his book aside and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Keep on!” Felo began again. “One dese nights
you goin’ see dat same cat cut yo’ breath fum you;
lay’n ’cross yo’ buzzum like dat.... An’ some
dese w’ite-folks only goin’ be too glad to say ’twan
nobody but nigger Felo did ’way wid you. An’
who you reckon goin’ be hyuh in de house to put it
on de cat, aft’ dey done spread de news?... Nobody.
Da’s who.”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos looked at him and asked quietly:</p>

<p>“Did you come up here to give a lecture on the
cat? Or did you say you had something worrying
you, and you wanted to talk about it?”</p>

<p>“I come up hyuh to look aft’ yo’ comfut,” he replied,
taking a pillow from the opposite side of the
bed and making ready to arrange it under Mr.
Amos’s head.</p>

<p>“Hyuh; lemme slip dis pilluh und’ yo’ head; an’
leave dat ole cat slide down further on yo’ stummic,
whah ’tain so dang’us.”</p>

<p>This little attention performed, Felo sat down in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the rocking chair and began looking about the
room, uncertain how to start his communication.
After an awkward silence, he asked:</p>

<p>“You goin’ keep on readin’?”</p>

<p>“What have you got to say?” Mr. Amos questioned,
without looking away from his book.</p>

<p>“Man, put yo’ book down, an’ be soshable,” he commanded.
“You ain’ sattafy peepin’ up in books all
day long, you gotta come hyuh at night-time
strainin’ yo’ eyesight over agin?... W’a’s de
matter, you don’ wan’ talk?”</p>

<p>“No; I want to listen,” said Mr. Amos, closing
the book and putting it aside. “What have you to
tell me?”</p>

<p>“I wan’ tell you ’bout a upsetment me an’ Lethe
had las’ night,” he began apologetically. “I know
Lethe done blabbed it all over Gritny by now; an’
I know she goin’ tell Miss Tilly; an’ Miss Tilly sho
ain’ goin’ miss tell you soon’s she see you; so I wan’
tell you de whole thing so you know de straight tale
w’en you hyeah it fum somebody else.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he gave a careful account of his visit
to Aunt Susan’s cook shop; the members he met and
talked with there; his misunderstanding with Lizzie,
and his late visit to the church; where he learned
that Lethe had gone home in a sullen frame of mind
over some wilful misinformation communicated to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
her by the vengeful Lizzie. Leaving the church with
the wake in full swing, he told how he went to
Lethe’s house, to find that she had gone to bed. He
knocked on the door and she got up and let him in;
finding fault with him for coming so late; and asking
why he hadn’t spent the night with the women
he began the evening with so pleasantly at Susan’s.</p>

<p>“I say to ’uh: For Gawd sake, Lethe, don’ try an’
raise no humbug late in de night like dis. I ain’
come hyuh to make no squawble over any lie Lizzie
Cole done hatched up jes’ for spite.</p>

<p>“I say: I come hyuh like I do evvy Sunday night;
’cause I wan’ see you, an’ ’cause I thinks somh’n
’bout you.... So dah whah I commence to undress
myself, an’ went to bed, ’cause I was
sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Went to bed!” Mr. Amos exclaimed in playful
amazement. “In Lethe’s house?... I didn’t
know that was part of the religious obligation of a
deacon of the church on Sunday night?”</p>

<p>“Dah ’tis again,” Felo commented, looking thoroughly
abashed. “Da’s de main reason I ain’ nev’
wan’ tell you nothin’ seecut. You all time wan’ twis’
things to make people look foolish.... Ain’ Lethe
an’ me bin knowin’ each-another for a long
time?... Ever sence she come yonder fum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Tuckapaw Parish,—an’ oughta be un’stan’ w’at
our feelin’s is by now?”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose Lethe is what your Bible calls
a concubine. You remember Solomon had several
hundred. But you must be careful not to have more
than two or three in Gretna. The ways of the church
have changed since Solomon’s day; and a deacon in
Gretna is expected to hold a high head among his
people.”</p>

<p>“Man, leave de Bible be; an’ quit reachin’ way
back yonder in ainshen days to git somh’n to make
game o’ people, an’ call ’um out dey name dat-a-way.
Lethe alright. An’ I kin give ’uh de praise
’bove inny cullud ooman I know w’at ain’ got no
husban’.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you do the decent thing and
marry her?”</p>

<p>“Marry who?” He asked in open-eyed amazement.
“You wan’ me marry Lethe wid de high temper she
got,—an’ jealous-hearted like she is, too?...
Man, you ain’ know w’at you say’n. You gotta see
Lethe in a high passion like I seen ’uh las’ night,
befo’ you fix it in yo’ min’ dat me an’ Lethe oughta
marry each-another.”</p>

<p>Besides, Lethe was suspicious-minded; he went on
enumerating. She was ready to believe anything
anybody told her. She had a tongue that wagged at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
both ends and blabbed everything she knew. It’s
bad for a nigger to be like that. But could she tell
what happened without exposing herself too?
Maybe she didn’t care about her reputation. But
what would the white folks think of him when they
heard it? How would he ever reinstate himself in
the church if they brought him up before the moderator
to make explanation? The elder and the deacon
were supposed to be more sanctified than common
members. But maybe Lethe wouldn’t say anything
after all.... But what made her listen to
that lying Lizzie, and ’cuse him of having other
women? Did he ever miss one Sunday night with
her since they fixed up the understanding between
them?... But that’s the way with a jealous-hearted
woman; you never know what she is going
to do. And you just got to wrassle with them when
they won’t listen to reason; and leave them to take
their comings, no matter how cheap it makes you
feel when everything is over.</p>

<p>“De mo’ I tried to talk easy an’ persuade ’uh she
was wrong,” Felo continued, “de mo’ louder she
answer back; searchin’ in ’uh min’ for nasty names
to make me shame;—an’ me lay’n up in de bed
strug’lin to git some sleep. All at once, I raise
my voice an’ say to ’uh: ‘Lethe, for Gawd sake don’
be so shameless. Try an’ shut yo’ evil-thinkin’ fly-trap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
an’ lay down an’ ax Gawd to help you pray.’
She ain’ said a word; but I seen ’uh reach over to
de pot-shelf an’ grab a skillet, an’ turn ’roun an’
commence to come ’cross de room. Dah whah I
jumped out de bed, an’ was huntin’ on de flo’ for
my pants, w’en she say: ‘Whah you think you
goin’?’</p>

<p>“I say: Lethe, I ain’ come hyuh tonight to make
no brawl wid no foolish ’ooman. I’m goin’ yonder
to Sis’ Fanny house whah I b’long, an’ lay down
wid a peaceful min’, an’ not be upset wid a shameless
thing like you is.</p>

<p>“She say: ‘You goin’ home, is you?... Well,
w’en you does go, I wan’ tell you ’tain’ nobody but
me an’ Gawd be witness you goin’ ’way from hyuh
cripple....’</p>

<p>“An’ dah whah she made at me wid de skillet, jes’
w’en I was pullin’ on one my pants laigs. I drapped
de thing on de flo’, an’ grabbed hol’ the skillet an’
wrenched it out ’uh han’; w’en she come up at me
full-fo’ce, like she wan’ scratch my face, either butt
me,—dang’us-lookin’ as innybody you ever seen.</p>

<p>“I ain’ stop to consider ’bout w’at to do; but I up
wid de skillet an’ plastud it ’cross ’uh face haphazzud.
An’ de nex’ thing I knowed, I seen three teeth
lay’n on de flo’, knocked clean out de front ’uh
mouth....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“Did I felt ’shame’?” Felo answered, slightly disconcerted
by Mr. Amos’s unexpected reproof.
“Da’s another subjec’.</p>

<p>“De thing w’at worried me mo’n anything else,
was how I could git home all dem five long blocks
’dout anybody seein’ me, aft’ I had re’lize I comed
away widout no pants on;—slippin’ long de street
in de moonlight wid blood all ove’ my und’shirt,
runnin’ de risk o’ somebody comin’ up on me an’
takin’ me for a rogue done commit murder, befo’
day in de mawnin’.</p>

<p>“I knowed Lethe could take care ’uhself. An’ I
knowed she had salt in de house; so I knowed
soon she had stop de bleedin’ from de mouth, she be
out o’ danger.</p>

<p>“So w’en I reached home an’ got in bed, I sho did
wrassel wid my soul, an’ prayed hard to fall asleep.
But Gawd mus’ bin vex wid me.... ’E helt de
sleep back from me; an’ I ain’ had a single wink
o’ sleep de whole night long.</p>

<p>“I tried to pray, but my min’ was upset wid all
kind o’ confusion.... I ain’ never notice befo’
how cows an’ creeters an’ things could be such
plumb nuisance in de night-time. Look like I could
hyeah evvy rooster in evvybody hen-house, crowin’
an’ ’nouncin’ de crackin’ o’ day all over Gritny.
An’ w’en de win’ blowed pass de house, I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
heayh de a-ko like a mul’tude o’ dogs barkin’ an’
callin’ at one-’nother, miles futher away.... An’
between dat hog Ma Fanny got yonder in de yard,
gruntin’ an’ goin’ on; an’ Miss Barb’ra cows nex’-do,
keepin’ up such a mooin’ an’ a moanin’; it look
like evvything was talkin’ ’bout some kin’ o’ tribulation
an’ on-res’ful cundition....</p>

<p>“Even de mawkin-bird singin’ in de umbrella tree
’ginse de fence, ’is voice so loud an’ screechy, it
soun’ like he findin’ fault wid de moon for shinin’
so bright. An’ I couldn’ help wishin’ de night air
make ’im ketch de so’ th’oat; den I know he had
to keep still.</p>

<p>“I say to myself: Dis ain’ doin’ no good; lay’n
hyuh frettin’, an’ big day already come....
Lemme git up an’ dress an’ go walk out-do’as in de
fresh air.</p>

<p>“So dah whah I put on my clo’se an’ went ’roun to
Lethe house to see’f I could patch up de diffunce
w’at comed up between us.</p>

<p>“I knocked on de do’ easy, but she ain’ answer.
I knocked agin a li’l louder, an’ call to ’uh, an’
she still ain’ answer.... I say: Maybe she gone
up de street to de doctor. I say: Lemme walk ’roun
a li’l piece, an’ I come back later an’ maybe she be
hyuh.</p>

<p>“So dah whah I went up de railroad track fur as de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Chinee-men’s garden; an’ I watched ’um hoein’ an’
plantin’ till almos’ a whole hour had pass; den I
start back. I walked slow, an’ picked a bunch o’
tetch-me-nots to bring to Lethe; growin’ so plennyful
’long-side de track, wid de night-jew on ’um,
an’ lookin’ so pink an’ nice an’ sweet-smellin’.</p>

<p>“I got to de house an’ it was shet tight, but smoke
was comin’ out de chimley. I say: Da’s a good
sign. She home; an’ she ain’ dead.... I knocked
on de do’, but she ain’ made no answer. I listen
to see’f I could hyeah walkin’ in de room, but evvything
was still. I knocked once mo’ an’ still she ain’
answer. Den I call to ’uh. I say: Lethe, dis
Felo.... I’m on my way ’cross de river, an’ I
come after my pants.</p>

<p>“Bimeby I could hyeah stirrin’ in de room; an’
nex’ thing I seen,—de window cracked open a li’l
piece, an’ my pants fell down on de gal’ry flo’. An’
den de window shet tight, like nobody was in de
house.</p>

<p>“I rolled de pants up in some newspaper I got to
de Dago stan’; an’ crossed on de ferry-boat, an’
come hyuh to de castle to consult wid you ’bout
w’at to do.... An’ now you got de whole story.”</p>

<p>“And the honor of hearing it well-told by the bold
hero himself,” Mr. Amos commented, looking at
him with an amused smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Man, don’ laugh an’ make game dat way,” returned
Felo, with quiet appeal. “Dis thing too much
like a tawment to my soul to try an’ joke ’bout
it.... How you reckon I’m goin’ feel if Lethe
go blab de thing all over Gritny, an’ de members
bring me up befo’ de church? ’Tain nothin’ to
play wid. Dis subjec’ is <i>seerus</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not concerned a bit over the loss of
Lethe’s teeth, are you?” Mr. Amos asked him.</p>

<p>“Lethe ain’ got to worry ’bout ’uh teeth,” Felo assured
him. “She know she gotta look to me to pay
de bill for fixin’ ’um. Lethe kin git new teeth; but
who you think goin’ puvvide me wid a good reppatashun,
after Lethe done spread de news, an’
my name bin walked on by a passul o’ mean-minded
Gritny niggers?... W’ich one be de
worse off den, me or Lethe?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose Lethe values her good name as
much as you do yours?” Mr. Amos argued with him.
“If she exposes you, she exposes herself. No
woman with pride will do a thing like that. She’ll
lie to protect herself. And you’ll see that Lethe
is no exception.”</p>

<p>Felo seemed greatly relieved, hearing this.</p>

<p>“Now, da’s de way I like to hyeah you talk,” he
said. “Straighten de thing out for me. Tell me w’at
I mus’ do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Go to see Lethe tomorrow and have an understanding
with her,” Mr. Amos suggested. “Tell
her you’re sorry, and you want to set things
right. Explain your position in the church, and
make her see hers as well. And if she cares anything
at all for you, she’ll certainly listen to reason.”</p>

<p>“Da’s suffishen,” Felo agreed, in a tone which
seemed to tell that he was resolved to fulfill his
duty. Then came an after-thought:</p>

<p>“But I sho Gawd hope dem missin’ teeth in de
front ’uh mouth goin’ make ’uh feel ’shame’ ’bout
’uh looks, an’ keep ’uh from goin’ in de street till
I git to see ’uh.”</p>

<p>“Start early in the morning,” Mr. Amos advised.
“Take the day off, and finish up the job before you
come back.”</p>

<p>A smile of appreciation lighted his face and his
voice resumed its habitual cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“Man, you sho got a good head for somebody bin
raised in Gritny. De onles diffunce twix’ you an’
me: you wise-minded from readin’ in books an’
things; an’ po’ me, I ain’ got nothin’ but mother-wit....
But I’m goin’ do jes’ like you say; an’
leave hyuh firs’ thing in de mawnin’, soon as I give
you yo’ coffee.”</p>

<p>“And be sure to take the touch-me-nots with you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
give to Lethe,” Mr. Amos reminded him, with a
playful smile.</p>

<p>Getting up from his chair suddenly, he pretended
to be greatly annoyed, and walked over to the bed-side
to cover his embarrassment, saying:</p>

<p>“Man, git up from hyuh, wid dat ole cat, an’ lemme
fix yo’ bed so you kin lay down an’ sleep an’ stop
thinkin’ up a whole lot o’ humbug.... Come on;
you done plague me enough for one night....
Lemme turn down de bed for you, so I kin go lay
down an’ pray.”</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-n.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter18">Next morning Felo was
away from the house before eight o’clock, on his
way to Gretna to make peace with the belligerent
Lethe. His mind was disturbed by many conflicting
emotions when he tried to think how she would receive
him.</p>

</div>

<p>As the ferry pulled in to the Gretna landing, his uneasiness
became intense; for he recognized several
of his colored friends on their way to the City to
dispose of their various wares. The pontoon was
crowded with <i>marchande</i> women, with large flat
baskets of vegetables balanced on their heads; the
careful arrangement of the shining, dew-washed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
maroon-colored beets, scarlet peppers, pale green
lettuce, and the golden carrots with plume-like foliage,
making the baskets from a distance appear like
gigantic, colorful hats decked for a rustic festival.</p>

<p>In the crowd he recognized Lizzie and Chester, each
with a basket of vegetables. If Lizzie had heard
anything from Lethe, she would be sure to mention
it. He was relieved when she spoke first.</p>

<p>“Hi! Mr. Felo,” she greeted him, as she came off
the boat. “Y’awter staid longer to de wake Sunday
night. We sho did give Aun’ Milly a good sen’-over.
I staid till close on to fo’ clock in de mawnin’.
An’ I wouldn’ a-lef’ den, but de coffee gived
out.”</p>

<p>“You know if Lethe goin’ to de burryin’?” Felo inquired
artfully.</p>

<p>“I ain’ seen Lethe since Sunday night, Mr. Felo. I
pass by ’uh house dis mawnin’, but it look like nobody
was home.”</p>

<p>This information reassured him. Lizzie knew nothing,
therefore Lethe had not told her trouble
abroad.</p>

<p>The boat bell rang, and Lizzie and Chester hurried
on board, calling to Felo, they hoped to see
him next Sunday. He waved good-by to them,
passing on with a feeling of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>As he turned into the street where Lethe lived, he
looked toward the house and saw a thin blue reek
of smoke curling up from the dilapidated chimney.
A mockingbird was sitting on the corner of the
roof, singing; telling the heedless world of the
prodigal beauty of the sunshine and the fleeting
glory of the morning.</p>

<p>“Da’s a good sign,” Felo commented. “Nobody
ain’ got no business bein’ down-casted w’en dumb
critters kin feel de sperret o’ Gawd wakin’-up inside
’um, like dat bird yonder shoutin’ ’bout it.”</p>

<p>He looked at the old house and thought how different
it seemed from the other night when he saw it
in the silent moonlight. How inviting it looked, with
the sunshine playing over the gallery and its rickety
old posts, covered with flowering vines; a veritable
basket of rampant wistaria and luxuriant
honeysuckle.</p>

<p>He opened the gate and went around the side way,
without calling. Lethe was in the back yard, feeding
chickens; and she didn’t see him until he came
where she was standing. She made no sign of recognition
until he spoke.</p>

<p>“Lethe, you don’ wan’ tell me good-mawnin’?” He
asked quietly. “If you feel like you don’ wan’
talk, I kin go back whah I come from.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Who invite you to come hyuh, any way?” She
asked, indifferently.</p>

<p>“I ain’ had to wait for no inv’tation,” he answered
curtly. “I come hyuh ’cause my min’ lead me to
come hyuh. To see how you gittin’ ’long.... To
bring you dis aw’inge-rine purzerve I made for
you.” (Offering her a glass of home-made orange
marmalade.)</p>

<p>She looked at him unmoved; without a show of surprise,
resentment or just indignation; wondering
what to say to him. Was he conscious of his meanness,
she thought. If so, was she ready to forgive
him, having had time to consider her unwarranted
jealousy, provoked by Lizzie’s malicious gossip?
But why did she doubt Felo when he tried to make
her know that Lizzie lied. She knew he never
showed any interest in other women as long as she
had known him. And if he came specially to see
her today, surely he would be ready to stand the
expense of a few missing teeth. What was the
loss of a few teeth compared with the loss of a
friendly company-keeper like Felo?... And any
way, wasn’t she the one who struck the first
blow?...</p>

<p>Having deliberated with herself to her apparent
satisfaction, she told him to put the glass of marmalade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
in the kitchen, “till I ketch me one dese chickens
to make some soup.”</p>

<p>“You goin’ have comp’ny?” Felo asked. The
thought of chicken seeming to indicate the approach
of some festive occasion.</p>

<p>“W’at I wan’ do havin’ comp’ny, wid all dese teeth
missin’ out de front o’ my mouth?” She replied
sharply; wondering at his total lack of judgment.
“People can’t eat chicken out dey own yard lessen
dey gotta have comp’ny to eat wid ’um?”</p>

<p>“I ain’ findin’ fault wid you ’bout yo’ likin’s,
Lethe,” he apologized. “I was thinkin’ ’bout you
settin’ down by yo’self, eating lonesome; ’dout anybody
to talk wid you, da’s all.”</p>

<p>Her frown seemed to deepen, and her voice assumed
a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Wa’t I want wid anybody comin’ hyuh to talk
to me, all lavadated like I is; wid all dese teeth
missin’ in de front o’ my mouth? You come hyuh
to make game an’ crow over me, ’stid o’ beggin’
my pardner for de nasty trick you done played on
me?... You ain’ think one li’l ole glass o’
aw’inge-rine purzerve kin make up for de wrong
you done commit, is you? You mus’ be a fatal fool,
if you do.”</p>

<p>Felo looked at her appealingly. He was ready to
make any number of apologies, if she would only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
listen. As for the teeth, she “oughta know de one
w’at broke ’um called on to put new ones in dey
place; if ’e any kind o’ man w’at calls ’imself a
man.”</p>

<p>“But some people waits a long time aft’ dey bin
called on; makin’ up dey min’ ’bout de thing dey
gotta do,” she told him. “An’ a toothless ooman ain’
need to have much patience w’en she look in de
glass an’ see how ugly she be.”</p>

<p>“Lethe, for Gawd sake don’ talk so fas’,” he
pleaded. “Go ketch yo’ chicken, like you say you
wan’ do; den leave us set down an’ talk de thing
over an’ un’stan’ one-’nother. ’Cause my min’ too
upset ’bout de whole business; an’ I wan’ try an’
git straight befo’ I go ’way from hyuh today. Go
ketch de chicken. I kin look to de stove an’ fix
de pot o’ scaldin’ water an’ things ready for you,
yonder in de kitchen.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he went into the house, Lethe’s silence
being a sign of approval.</p>

<p>As he walked away, Lethe threw a handful of feed
from the pan she held, and the chickens gathered
about her and began pecking greedily. After looking
them over carefully, she selected the one she
wanted; stooped slowly and grabbed the unwary
chicken by the neck. She took a tight grasp just below
its head and began swinging it around vigorously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Two or three times it went around in a circle
at arm’s length; when suddenly it was severed,
the body of the chicken falling to the ground, the
head remaining in her hand. The frightened hens
ran off, squawking; and the roosters ran over where
the bleeding victim lay kicking, pecking at it and
making loud commotion. Lethe stood by and
watched it until the last sign of life was gone; then
stooped and picked it up and went into the house.</p>

<p>Felo was ready with the pot of scalding water,
which he poured over the chicken when Lethe put
it in the dishpan. After it cooled a bit, he began
picking off the feathers; while Lethe busied herself
with other preparations for the little meal for two.
The time being propitious, Felo made ready to unburden
himself, and began his explanation. His
talk was free and persuasive, and Lethe listened,
offering little or no dissenting comment. She could
appreciate his feeling of pride, and assured him
that she would be the “las’ person in dis worl’ to put
bad mouth on him an’ roll any stone in his way.”</p>

<p>He told her he was glad that he had not been disappointed
in her, and thanked her profusely. She
was the right kind of a woman. He “always knowed
she was’n no shoo-fly, picayune nigger; an’ knowed
still better now, since he done had good chance to
tes’ her senserra.” (Sincerity.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>While the chicken boiled they sat talking of Lizzie
and Chester; Aunt Milly’s funeral, which was to
take place that day; and many other things of
mutual importance—Lethe getting up from time
to time to add the necessary vegetables and seasoning
to the chicken soup to “give it supshun.” She
“stirred up a bowl o’ batter for pan-cakes,” which
she fried in bacon grease; and as soon as she finished
dripping a pot full of strong coffee, they sat down
to eat.</p>

<p>It was a veritable feast to Felo, now the old relations
were re-established between them; and he
hated the thought of leaving. But he was obliged
to be on duty when Mr. Amos came home in the
evening. He wanted Lethe to go to Aunt Milly’s
funeral for a “li’l pleasan’ change o’ mind”; but she
said she “felt too ’shame’ to face a big crowd o’
people wid no teeth in her mouth”; that she would
stay at home.</p>

<p>He told her good-by at the front gate, and started
home feeling like he had a “whole nes’ full o’ butterflies
turned loose in his stummick.”</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter19">Lizzie Cole was one
of those ignorant, reckless children of Nature, utterly
disregardful of the simplest rudiments of
anything resembling law or religion; in consequence
of which, she was unable to live at home with her
God-fearing father and conventional step-mother.
For a long time she had lived by herself, in a
decrepit-looking two-room hut, far across the pasture
in the East Green, away on the other side of
the town.</p>

</div>

<p>The old shanty sat back in the yard, partly hidden
from the road by a high, dilapidated picket fence
and a hedge of giant cocklebur bushes; with two
scraggy persimmon trees on one side by way of
ornament.</p>

<p>If you happened to pass by on wash day, and saw
the cocklebur bushes decorated with innumerable
articles of clothing of every imaginable color, you
soon learned their usefulness and lost sight of the
unnecessary expense of a clothes-line. It also gave
you a better understanding of Lizzie’s impatience
with anyone who stupidly advised cutting the
cocklebur bushes down as worthless weeds and
dangerous breeding places for snakes and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>From time to time, Chester made “guests visits” to
the retired hut; doing the cooking, washing, sewing
and other domestic work; while Lizzie walked out
selling blackberries and vegetables; or went gallivanting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
here and there in search of friendly entertainment.</p>

<p>To Lizzie’s cheerful way of thinking, there was no
form of pleasure more enjoyable than a “good
funeral.” The news of anybody’s dying always
wakened up her spirits; and she “never missed
goin’ to a wake or burrin’ if Gawd lef’ her strank
to git there.”</p>

<p>It was just about sunset when Lizzie came back
from Aunt Milly’s funeral. Chester was in the yard,
washing, under the persimmon trees; and long before
he saw her, he heard her coming across the pasture
singing gaily. As she opened the gate and
came in, she called to him good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“Leave dem ole tubs alone for tonight, Chester,
an’ come-in-doahs; I wan’ tell you ’bout evvything
w’at happened.”</p>

<p>He followed her into the house, eager to hear
all she had to tell.</p>

<p>The room was dark, and he lit a candle and put it on
the mantelpiece. A sickly fire was smoldering on the
hearth; and after raking the coals together and
starting it to burn well with a few shingles, he
threw a large piece of wood across the andirons,
and sat down on the floor.</p>

<p>The place was orderly; the floor, spotlessly clean.
Near the window was a deal table with a few dishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and pans on it, and a wooden bucket of drinking
water and a dipper. Across from the chimney in the
“guest corner” of the room, was a low cot covered
with a patch-work quilt, a trophy from one of
Carmelite’s raffles; a gay masterpiece of bewildering
design which she called the “fifty revalashuns
of de forty-seven wonders.” The walls were
covered with newspapers, ornamented here and
there with gay-colored circus posters and magazine
covers; and the mantelshelf, decorated with a
towering pyramid of empty coffee, tomato and baking-powder
cans, bright and shining as “any natchal
silver on de w’ite-folks side-boa’d.”</p>

<p>While Chester was fixing the fire, Lizzie had gone
into the adjoining room and taken off her shoes and
exchanged her “good street clo’se” for a “sloven
fit”; so her body, as well as her mind, might enjoy
perfect freedom of movement throughout the evening
conference.</p>

<p>“Now, I kin talk to my natchal comfut,” she said
to Chester, coming into the room and drawing a
stool before the fire and sitting down near him.</p>

<p>Chester was all attention, so there was little need
for useless preliminaries. Looking at the fire meditatively
Lizzie began her interesting soliloquy, her
voice low and quiet.</p>

<p>“Nobody can’t say that ole Aunt Milly didn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
a fine burryin’,” she told him.... “Look like people
had come from every direction to sing over
Aunt Milly just for ole time sake; and because she
come from so far away.... Look like some people
shed tears over Aunt Milly because she was
gone; and some for the good she did.... And she
never knowed one woman her own color, old or
young, to have so many fine flowers at one time;
flowers so natchal till they looked artificial....</p>

<p>“But de one thing goin’ keep my min’ rollin’ for
a long time,” she continued, stressing every word
with dramatic fervor, “was de soun’ o’ dat water
gluggin’ in de coffin w’en dey let Aun’ Milly down
in de grave.... De same way you hyeah it go
glug-glug-glug w’en you hol’ a empty bottle und’
de water, an’ de soun’ keep on’ gluggin’ till de
bottle be filled up.... Yas, Lawd.</p>

<p>“It sho was a soun’ dat made me cunsider w’at I
want y’all do wid me w’en de time come for puttin’
me away.... An’ Chester, I want you look to
it; you hyeah me?... You know dis lan’ is a
swampy lan’; an’ it hol’s de water a long time;
’specially aft’ a heavy rain bin fall. An’ you kin
bail de water out a grave much as you want, but you
can’ keep it from seepin’ back in agin.... So you
make ’um put me way up on a top shelf in dat
big tomb ’long-side de back fence, yonder in de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Gates o’ Mary, high an’ dry out de flood. ’Cause I
sho don’ wan’ think ’bout bein’ drownded aft’ I
done died in my bed natchal.... No Lawd, not
me!”</p>

<p>“Sho mus’ bin made Aun’ Amy felt bad,” Chester
commiserated.</p>

<p>“Who?” Lizzie exclaimed with sudden animation.
“Aun’ Amy ain’ knowed a single thing w’at went
on w’en dey put Aun’ Milly way.... She fell to
sleep in de ca’idge on de way to de graveyard;
an’ w’en dey reached de place, an’ wan’ try an’
make Aun’ Amy git out an’ walk to de grave-side,
leadin’ de moaners; de po’ ole soul was so helpless
drunk, dey had to leave ’uh settin’ up in de ca’idge
in de road.... An’ she ain’ took no part in <i>none</i>
de excitement.”</p>

<p>Chester laughed heartily. “Lawd! I’m sho sorry
I missed goin’ wid you,” he remarked. “But stop
talkin’ ’bout dead people, Lizzie; an’ tell who else
you seen yonder.”</p>

<p>“Chester, you ain’ expec’ me to tell you ’bout all dat
mult’tude o’ niggers dey had to Aun’ Milly funeyun,
is you?” Lizzie asked, playfully. “De main
thing I got to tell you, is ’bout Sis’ Tempe. Me an’
her walked home together; an’ chile, w’at she had
to say, sho got my min’ upset thinkin’ ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“W’at make you wan’ worry ’bout anything Sis’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Tempe tell you? Don’t you know Tempe ain’ bin
right ever since Unc’ Peesah died? An’ her min’
comes and goes?” Chester reminded her.</p>

<p>“Da’s de very thing I’m comin’ to,” Lizzie answered.
“Tempe simple-minded, I know. But if
she keep on goin’ ’roun ’munks people an’ talkin’
like she talk to me today; ’tain goin’ be but <i>one</i> po’
nigger land in jail befo’ de end o’ dis year be over;
a’ dat nigger ain’ goin’ be nobody but Chester.”</p>

<p>“W’at thing dis is Tempe done mixed me up in?”
Chester asked in dull amazement.</p>

<p>Lizzie told him how Tempe complained to her about
everything going to ruin since Peesah died, leaving
her with nobody to take care of the place. How the
garden needed plowing, and nobody wanted to do
it for her. How she thought of selling her mule and
dump cart to Nat, because she had no money to
keep them; and what money she got by selling
them would buy food and clothes and all she
needed.... That she knew somebody was burning
a candle over her to keep bad luck in her way
just for “envy-stripe”.... That she was sure of
it; because she found red pepper and buzzard
feathers and candle-sperm tracks on her front
door steps, three Friday mornings hand-running....</p>

<p>But they couldn’t fool her. She knew who it was;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
and wasn’t afraid to tell, either.... It wasn’t nobody
but the same sly nigger that lived next-door
to her the time Peesah died so sudden....
Couldn’t be nobody else.... That’s why he
moved away from next door.... To keep people
from knowing anything about the needle....
But Gawd don’t sleep. And everything got to come
out when God command you to speak your
mind....</p>

<p>And Peesah had come to her in her sleep three
times already. And she saw the needle in his hand
plain as day. And he called out to her so loud, her
sleep was broke for the rest of the night....</p>

<p>“She say she hyeah’d Unc’ Peesah call to ’uh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tempe, take dis needle back!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Put it in de place whah de needle b’lonks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lissen w’at I tell you, an’ do w’at I say!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“An’ dah whah she say she seen de needle in ’uh
own han’; but Unc’ Peesah was gone clean out o’
sight.”</p>

<p>Chester looked about the room uneasily; and got
up and closed the front door. Lizzie watched him,
waiting for him to speak. He went over to the cot
and sat down, looking at her questioningly.</p>

<p>“You think Tempe seen Peesah sperret sho’ ’nuff?”
He asked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Da’s de very thing I wan’ know myself,” she answered.
“But ain’t you say Tempe min’ comes an’
goes?... Maybe ’tain’ nothin’ but Tempe ’maginashun
make ’uh think she seen Unc’ Peesah sperret.”</p>

<p>“But ain’ she say she had de needle in ’uh own han’
aft’ he done lef’?” Chester reminded her.</p>

<p>“Da’s w’at she say,” Lizzie answered. “An’ if you
wan’ b’lieve ’uh, it sho look like de needle p’intin’
to’ads you bein’ de lawful owner; Tempe nex’-do’
neighbor, de time Unc’ Peesah died. Don’t
it?”</p>

<p>He couldn’t deny that Tempe had come to him for
the needle and that he had given it to her. Lizzie
knew that he had always been an obliging neighbor
to Tempe, lending her anything she needed if he
happened to have it.</p>

<p>The evening Uncle Peesah “took down wid de
colic,” Tempe ran over to Chester to borrow a
needle and thread to “sew up a salt-sack full o’ hot
bran, to lay on Peesah stummick to ease de mizry.”
Chester gave her the needle and thread and she
went home with it. Late that night Uncle Peesah
died; and Tempe told every one that his death was
caused from eating cucumber salad and buttermilk.
It was a reasonable excuse, and as nobody bothered
about making any sort of examination to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the real cause, Tempe felt perfectly secure.
But Chester had his doubts. Tempe had long confided
her troubles to him, and he knew how Peesah’s
unfaithfulness had aroused her jealousy on numerous
occasions; and how she had threatened to wreak
vengeance, and “git even wid ’im for runnin’ wid
yuther wimmins.” Therefore it was natural for
Chester to suspect her of using the borrowed needle
for a secret instrument of fatal despatch.</p>

<p>“But who you think goin’ pay any ’tenshun to
Tempe ramblin’ talk ’bout who de needle b’lonks
to?” Chester asked, after thoughtful consideration.
“Nobody ain’ goin’ know w’at she mean.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ain’ goin’ know?” Lizzie demanded. “You
better look ove’ yo’ min’, boy; an’ think on Felo
an’ Soongy an’ ole treach’ous Gussie, an’ all dem
yuther niggers dey had to Susan house Sunday,
w’en you was tellin’ ’bout how Unc’ Peesah
died.... You ain’ think you safe from suspicion
wid all dem tongues waggin’; once dey done learned
Tempe puttin’ de blame on you. Is you?”</p>

<p>“How you reckon I’m goin’ keep ’um from talkin’?”
He appealed to her. “I ain’ see no way I kin
stop ’um, if dey wan’ lissen at w’at a crazy ooman
say.”</p>

<p>“Da’s de very thing you gotta consider,” Lizzie
advised him. “You gotta go see Tempe, an’ talk to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
’uh bol’ an’ brazen; an’ make ’uh un’stan she gotta
keep still; lessen you give way de whole truth ’bout
de thing; an’ bring ’uh up befo’ de law, an’ make
’um prove who de guilty one. Da’s w’at you gotta
do.... An’ you better go dis very night; aft’ you
done had a li’l somh’n to eat. So come on; lessus
git somh’n ready right now. An’ you go yonder
to Tempe house soon’s you git thoo.”</p>

<p>Chester got up, and placed two bricks at the front
of the hearth, then raked out a small pile of coals
between them. He filled a pot with water from the
bucket on the table and put it over the bricks, to
boil for coffee: Lizzie cut a few slices of salt pork
which she took from a basket hanging from a
rafter near the window; laid them in a skillet with
some grease and sliced onions, and put it over the
fire to fry. She cut some cheese, broke a loaf of
twist-bread in several parts, put the bread and
cheese on a plate, and placed it by the side of the
hearth. When the coffee was made and the meat
was fried, she filled a pan for Chester and one for
herself, and they sat down before the fire and began
eating.</p>

<p>Neither one seemed inclined to talk, feeling that
conversation of any kind would cause delay; and
Chester’s visit to Tempe had to be accomplished
that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>As soon as he finished drinking his coffee, Lizzie
said to him: “Leave evvything be, jes like it is, an’
you go straight off. An’ be sho you make Tempe
un’stan good, dat you know w’at you know....
An’ don’ talk too timmasun (timorous) either.”</p>

<p>Chester nodded assent; put on his hat and coat,
and started off across the pasture, on his way to
Tempe’s.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter20">At every second street corner
of the town, as a protection in time of fire,
there were large underground wells, bricked-in and
covered over with heavy boards. In time of
drouth, when the supply of cistern water had to be
economized for drinking purposes, the villagers
used the well water for their cattle, truck gardens,
and for washing clothes; but owing to the earthy,
swampy taste of the water, it was unfit for drinking.</p>

</div>

<p>The floor-like tops of these wells were delightful
gathering places for the colored children of the
neighborhood on moonlight nights. Here they
would congregate for their merry games and
romping; the pleasant sound of their happy voices
becoming a sort of evening service for the old folks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
who came out of doors to sit on the gutter-curb
and doorsteps, eager to enjoy a bit of friendly gossip
after a long day’s toil.</p>

<p>Tempe was sitting in the doorway of her house,
in the glowing moonlight, smoking her pipe and listening
to the singing children at the corner, when
Chester came up to her.</p>

<p>“’Deevnin’, Sis’ Tempe,” he greeted her politely.
“I was wond’rin if I was goin’ fin’ you at yo’
house. You know who dis is, don’t you?”</p>

<p>She looked at him quietly, making no sign of recognition.</p>

<p>“Dis me, Sis’ Tempe,” he said, taking a seat near
her. “Dis Chester. Chester Frackshun, w’at use
to live ’longside you, yonder ’cross de green.”</p>

<p>“I ain’ forgot who you is,” she told him, looking
at him searchingly. “I ain’ forget nothin’.... An’
you ain’ need to tell me w’at you come after,
either. Cause I’m sho goin’ give de thing back to
de lawful owner, now you done come hyuh.”</p>

<p>Getting up to go into the house, she said to him:
“Set hyuh on de do’-step till I come back.”</p>

<p>“Lemme come inside wid you, Sis’ Tempe,” Chester
suggested, getting up to follow her. “I wan’
talk wid you on a li’l business.”</p>

<p>“Stay right whah you is till I come back, I tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
you,” she commanded, looking at him fixedly for
several seconds before going inside.</p>

<p>Chester sat down again and waited on the steps for
her to return.</p>

<p>After a while she came back with a cup of salt in
her hand, and stood mumbling some unintelligible
words, as she sprinkled the salt across the threshold,
in the form of a cross. Having finished, she said to
him:</p>

<p>“De one dey call Chester kin come in, now. But
w’at be fol’rin ’im, gotta stay out-do’s.”</p>

<p>He made no comment about the strange invitation,
but got up and went inside.</p>

<p>The room was in semi-darkness; the only light being
the reflected glow of a candle in the back room,
and a narrow stream of moonlight coming through
the open door at the front, falling across the well-scrubbed
floor like a stripe of tarnished silver.</p>

<p>“Set hyuh whah I kin seen you,” Tempe said; placing
a chair near the door where the moonlight
would fall across him.</p>

<p>Chester took the offered seat, and Tempe sat down
opposite, half-hidden in the shadow.</p>

<p>“You mus’ bin know I wan’ see you?” she asked.
And without waiting for his reply, she went on
speaking in a kind of ecstasy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Boy, de sperret o’ Gawd don’ never work in
vain.</p>

<p>“An’ don’t you never try to b’lieve de sperret gives
up.</p>

<p>“E knows ’is own strank; an’ ’e knows ’is time.</p>

<p>“An’ soon or later, ’e sho goin’ track you down,
an’ all de wrong-doin’ you done commit in de dark,
de sperret o’ Gawd goin’ drag it fo’th an’ shame
you in de light o’ day!</p>

<p>“Yas, Jesus.... You hyeah me talkin’?”</p>

<p>“Yas. I hyeah you talkin’,” Chester answered abruptly.
“But w’at you talkin’ ’bout, Sis’ Tempe,
ain’ nothin’ cuncernin’ me. You better ’zamine yo’
own cawnshunce, an’ see w’at de sperret o’ Gawd
goin’ bring to light to ’cuse you wid yo’ own-self....
An’ don’t you try to drag me in de thing
either.... ’Cause you know w’at you know. An’
I know a heap mo’ on de subjec’ w’at you ain’ never
thought over.... So dey got two’v us to git up
an’ talk on de queshtun, w’en de time come for
provin’ who got to stan’ de blame.... So you
better cunsider long an’ careful, befo’ you go ’roun
hyuh talkin’ so broadcas’.... You hyeah w’at
I tell you?”</p>

<p>His tone was severe and emphatic; and she sat
looking at him in subdued silence. He felt sorry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
for her, and wanted her to know that he was willing
to help her any way he could.</p>

<p>“You ain’ got to be ’fraid o’ me, Sis’ Tempe,” he
told her feelingly. “Don’t you know ’tain’ nobody
but you an’ me kin tell anything ’bout de
needle?... Put de thing out yo’ ’membunce, an’
stop worrin’ ’bout it. Talkin’ too much on de thing
only goin’ make people mo’ suspicious; an’ dat ain’
goin’ help you none.”</p>

<p>Tempe contemplated his face in the moonlight for a
few seconds before answering.</p>

<p>“But Peesah de one don’ wan’ lemme res’,” she faltered.
“Evvy night, w’en I be sleepin’, ’e comes to
me des like ’is natchal self, an’ tawments my po’
soul ’bout dat needle so, till I has to git up out de
bed an’ walk ’roun’ de room, an’ try’n fin’ somh’n
to do to ease my min’.”</p>

<p>Chester told her of several charms he was sure
would help her. The old folks said they were the
only protection against ghosts and spirits, and they
couldn’t fail if you did them the right way.—A pan
of water on the door-step in the moonlight: Death
won’t cross water while the moon is shining on it.—A
mirror placed by the side of the bed: Death
don’t want to see himself in a looking-glass.—Leave
a dog in the room when you go to bed; dogs can see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
spirits in the dark, and Death don’t like to hear
a dog howl in the night-time.</p>

<p>Tempe said she had tried them all, and none of the
charms had helped her.</p>

<p>He told her about putting nettles on the floor; scattered
over the threshold and sprinkled around the
bed: Death wouldn’t walk on “stingin’-nettles” in
the house, because he had to walk on them in the
graveyard. But the nettles had to be picked at midnight,
when the heavy dew was on them.</p>

<p>Tempe told him she was glad to know the new
charm, and would try it that night. She knew where
some nettles were growing alongside Miss Collamore’s
fence by the corner. Maybe white-folks’ nettles
would be better. She would wait until midnight,
and go pick them, and sprinkle them on the
floor before she went to bed.</p>

<p>Chester assured her that the charm would work;
and he felt pleased that he was able to give her
something that would divert her attention from the
mysterious needle, and the accusing thoughts that
disturbed her mind. He wished her good luck, and
arose to go; saying that he would pass by in the
morning to hear what happened.</p>

<p>Tempe followed him to the door and said good-night.
Just as he was leaving, Nat came along; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
stopping in front of the door-step, saluted them
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Great-day-in-de-mawnin’, Sis’ Tempe!” He exclaimed.
“It done took me so long to walk way
down hyuh to see you tonight, I feel like I bin
trav’lin de road since day-break.... W’at make
you wan’ live so further away like dis, anyhow?...
An’ how you do dis evenin’?... An’
boy, I’m sho glad dey got somebody hyuh to help
me wid dat mule I come after. Hitchin’-up a strange
mule in de moonlight by yo’-self ain’ no fun, lemme
tell you. ’Cause I know Sis’ Tempe ain’ none too
handy w’en it come to handlin’ harness an’ things,
an’ backin’-up a sleepy mule in a dump-cart shaf’,
long aft’ hours like dis is.... Ain’ da’s right,
Sister?”</p>

<p>“I was lookin’ for you to come hyuh in de day-time,”
Tempe told him. “Aft I see de night fell,
an’ you ain’ sont no word one way o’ nother; somh’n
tol’ me maybe you done change yo’ min’ ’bout
buyin’ de mule.”</p>

<p>“But you see me hyuh now, don’t you?” Nat argued.
“Anybody ever told you ’bout Nat goin’ back
’is word, aft’ he done promise somebody he goin’
buy somh’n from ’um? An’ de thing be somh’n
w’at he need?”</p>

<p>“Unc’ Nat, w’at make you wan’ was’e time dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
way, an’ bring up a onnes’sary wrangle?” Chester
asked him. “If you wan’ hitch-up de mule to take
home wid you tonight, you better come on an’
lemme help you; ’cause I gotta go back ’cross de
pastur to Lizzie house befo’ it git too late.”</p>

<p>“Boy, you sho talkin’ gospel,” Nat answered.
“Come on, Sis’ Tempe, an’ show me whah de mule
at; an’ lemme git thoo an’ go ’way from hyuh.”</p>

<p>“De mule dis way in de yard,” said Tempe, coming
out of the house and leading them through the side
gate. “But you gotta fetch a bucket o’ water from
de well, yonder to de cawnder; ’cause de po’ critter
ain’ had no water to drink all day. I ain’ able to
tote no water.”</p>

<p>She hunted about the yard until she found a bucket
with a rope tied to the handle. She gave it to Chester
and he went to fetch the water from the well at the
corner. The children had ended their singing and
playing for the night and were gone home; and the
deserted street seemed to be wondering at the untimely
silence coming at an hour of such marvellous
moonlight.</p>

<p>Getting down on his knees, Chester tugged with
the cover of the well until he lifted it out of its
groove. Then he let the bucket down through the
narrow opening, dangling and swinging it about
until it sank. When it was filled with water he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
pulled it up; got up on his feet, and made ready to
get back to Nat. He deliberated for a second
whether or not to close the well.</p>

<p>“Might be I gotta come git a yuther bucket,”
he said to himself. “De dev’lish lid so tight to git
loose, I’m goin’ leave it stay open till I come back
agin.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he took up the bucket of water and
went back to the yard.</p>

<p>Nat had finished hitching the mule and was standing
by the dump cart talking to Tempe. Chester
put the bucket of water before the mule and he
drank it greedily, and seemed eager for more. Chester
wanted to go for another bucketful, but Nat
was impatient to get away, and told him not to
go.</p>

<p>“One bucketful enough to hol’ ’im till we git up
yonder on the coas’; den he kin lap de whole ditch
dry if he like, w’en I turn ’im loose in de lane....
Come on, lemme go ’way from hyuh,” he said, climbing
up on the seat of the cart. “An’ Sis’ Tempe,
I’ll see you ’bout de secon’ payment aft’ I done
tried de mule out wid de harrow in de fiel’ tomorrow....
An’ boy, lemme thank you for givin’
me a han’ wid de mule nice like you did. An’ I’ll sho
think to bring you somh’n from de g’yarden, nex’
time I come down to Gritny.... Peace an’ hap’ness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
to y’all.... Come on, ole mule. Nat’s
gone.”</p>

<p>The cart went bumping up the street, and Tempe
closed the gate and walked with Chester towards
the front door. As she went into the house, he reminded
her to go for the nettles at midnight; and
to be sure that nobody saw her when she stooped
to pick them. Tempe said she would remember to
do all he told her; bade him good-night and closed
the door as he walked away.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter21">Eager to get back and
tell Lizzie the outcome of his visit to Tempe, Chester
took the short cut across the pasture. The moonlight
was so brilliant, he could trace the entire
length of the worn pathway through the shining
dew-dripping weeds along its edges. A cool breeze
was blowing from the woods, and the dampness
of the grass causing him to feel chilly, he pulled
up his coat. As he walked along, singing, he was
conscious of being pleased that he had accomplished
something. He had spoken his mind and felt satisfied
that Tempe would stop talking, and no blame
would be attached to his name. Lizzie would be
glad to know how he straightened things out with
Tempe, and she would stop worrying about his getting
into trouble.</p>

</div>

<p>When he reached home, the door was closed and the
house was in total darkness. Lizzie had gone to bed;
and he knew he would have to go in quietly, because
if he wakened her, she would be cross and make a
racket.</p>

<p>Disappointed that he would have to wait until
morning to tell her about his visit, he undressed
quietly and got into bed. The sound of snoring
in the next room told him that Lizzie was in her
“first sleep”; so he knew that it would be a long
time before she would awake. Thinking he might
forget his disappointment, he began to pray.</p>

<p>However short and simple of form his sincere
appeal may have been, it served him as might any
formula of cabalistic worth. Bringing to his childish
mind not only quiet forgetfulness; but quick,
conquering somnolence, with a myriad train of
fantastic visions; tantalizing his superstitious soul,
and holding him in helpless captivity until the mystic
hour of midnight came to break the spell.</p>

<p>A rooster, high up on a branch of the persimmon
tree in the side yard, looking out across the pasture,
and seeing the moon slipping down the heavens,
flapped his wings lustily and gave a ringing
salute that floated off on the wind to tell his fellow-fowls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
that morning was on the way to greet the
sleeping world.</p>

<p>Chester heard the clarion sound in the tangle of his
dream, and awaking with a start, he jumped out
of bed and ran to Lizzie’s room, calling to her
excitedly:</p>

<p>“Lizzie! You ’wake?” He shouted, going to the
bed-side, and shaking her roughly. “Wake up, for
Gawd sake; an’ lemme talk to you!... Did you
hyeah dat noise jes’ now befo’ I come in de
room?”</p>

<p>Lizzie sat up quickly and answered in an angry
tone:</p>

<p>“Boy, you mus’ be losin’ yo’ min’, ain’t you? W’at
you mean, comin’ hyuh an’ wakin’ me out my
slumbers, axin’ me ’bout any noise, like somebody
done gone crazy?... Go back to bed, yonder
in yo’ room. An’ damn you an’ dis kind o’ humbug;
way in de middle o’ de night like dis!... You
ain’ walkin’ in yo’ sleep, is you?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie, for Gawd sake lissen at w’at I’m try’n to
tell you,” he pleaded. “Ain’t you hyeah’d de noise,—like
somebody callin’ for help?... Callin’ an’
moanin’ so pitiful, it woke me out a heavy
sleep.... Gawd knows. I could hyeah it plain
as day.... An’ ’long wid de moanin’ I could
heayh de soun’ like water splashin’.... Gawd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
knows, Lizzie.... An’ I dunno w’at make you
ain’ bin able to hyeah it, loud an’ natchal as dat
thing was soundin’.”</p>

<p>Becoming suddenly aware of the humor of the
situation, Lizzie began laughing with keen enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Nigger, you mus’ bin had de night-mare,” she told
him. “You better go look an’ see if you ain’ knocked
over dat bucket o’ water on de table yonder....
Talkin’ ’bout hyeahin’ water splashin’.... Go
back to bed, boy, an’ lay down. An’ quit dis foolishness,
an’ lemme git some mo’ sleep.”</p>

<p>Determined to convince her that what he heard
was no imaginary sound, he persisted:</p>

<p>“Lizzie, w’at make you think I wan’ joke on somh’n
seerus like dis thing is?... I tell you de noise
I hyeah’d was a reel, <i>natchal</i> noise. An’ it kep’ up
de whole time I was gittin’ out o’ bed till I got
hyuh an’ shuck you ’wake. An’ w’en I commence
walkin’ ’cross de room, it look like all my laigs was
stingin’ me, same as if somebody bin switchin’ ’um
wid stingin’-nettles.”</p>

<p>“Chester, git out o’ hyuh, wid yo’ lyin’ self!” Lizzie
commanded, with a show of irritation. “Hyuh you
done laid up in yo’ bed half de night in a crooked
position, till yo’ blood done gone to sleep; an’
come tellin’ me ’bout somebody switchin’ yo’ laigs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
wid stingin’-nettles!... Git out o’ hyuh....
’Cause I know if I raise up out dis bed an’ shove
you thoo dat do’, you sho Gawd will go lay down,
aft’ my han’s done fell on you.... You hyeah
w’at I’m say’n?”</p>

<p>“I hyeah you,” he answered forlornly. “But you
watch if you don’ hyeah bad news tomorrow mornin’.... A
callin’ noise like dat noise I hyeah’d,
sho do puhdick somh’n.... An’ Jesus goin’ be
my witness I ain’ lissen at nothin’ on-natchal dis
night o’ my good Lawd.”</p>

<p>Leaning over the side of the bed, Lizzie trailed her
hand along the floor until she found one of her
shoes. Suspecting her intention, Chester started
to leave the room, when she fired the shoe at him,
shouting:</p>

<p>“Git out o’ hyuh, I tell you! An’ don’t you lemme
hyeah you say another word tonight.”</p>

<p>Unable to sleep, he lit a candle on the mantelshelf,
and sat down on the side of his cot, trying to calm
himself. He tried to pray, but he could not concentrate,
his mind was so disturbed. The room was
cold, and the dim cheerless light of the candle made
him uncomfortable. Maybe if he lit a fire and made
some coffee he would feel stronger, he thought.</p>

<p>Taking some dried leaves and chips from the box
in the corner, he put them on the hearth between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the andirons; laid a few branches over them and
lighted the fire with the candle. As the bright flame
leaped up the chimney, brightening the room with
a cheerful glow, and streaking the floor and ceiling
with long quivering shadows; he sat down before
the hearth and began humming softly.</p>

<p>Seeing the reflection through the open door, and
hearing the low rumble of his voice, Lizzie called
to him impatiently:</p>

<p>“Chester, if you think you goin’ hol’ a all-night
swaree yonder in dat kitchen wid nobody but yo’
fool-self, you better come close dis do’, so dat light
won’ keep me from sleepin’.”</p>

<p>He got up and closed the door quietly; went over
to his cot and took the quilt; and after wrapping
it about him, he drew a chair before the fire and
sat down. The genial warmth and the soothing
crackling of the burning branches set his mind to
thinking of other things; and very soon he found
himself tranquilly sinking into utter forgetfulness;
snugly enfolded by the “fifty revelashuns of de
forty-seven wonders.”</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter22">The season for growing
things being almost over, only a few vegetables
were left in Nat’s garden. Several beds of sweet
potatoes and pumpkin vines told that a few yams
and cashaws remained to be gathered; and there
was still a small supply of succulent spinach, bordered
with rows of bright green parsley; and plenty
of glossy red peppers on the sturdy bushes growing
along the side fence.</p>

</div>

<p>Before seven o’clock in the morning, with a warm
sunshine falling over everything, Nat was at work
with Tempe’s mule hitched to the harrow; trying
to get the ground ready for lettuce planting before
the first frost fall.</p>

<p>Up and down the long rows of lumpy ground he
followed the harrow, singing pleasantly to amuse
himself; apparently satisfied with the mule for the
work he had in mind. The sunshine was bright and
comforting; and nothing disturbed his meditations
except the playful sniffing and barking of his three
dogs, Leave-it-lay, Scawl and one-eye Companyun,
following at his heels, hunting out toads and
ground-puppies under the newly-broken clods.</p>

<p>At length, the click of the iron latch on the front
gate attracted Nat’s attention; and looking up, he
saw a woman with a <i>marchande</i> basket coming
down the grassy path. As she came nearer, Nat
recognized Scilla, coming to buy vegetables to take
to the City to sell. She was walking hurriedly, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
seemed to be excited. Before reaching him, she
called out breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Lawd, Unc’ Nat! W’at you reckon done happen?...
An’ had to fall on me, to be de firs’ one to see
de thing; an’ go spread de news, yonder in
Gritny.”</p>

<p>Unmoved, Nat looked at her, and answered
quietly:</p>

<p>“Ooman, take yo’ time; an’ don’ trip ove’ yo’ words
so fas’. W’at excitement dis is, you done brought
hyuh so soon in de mawnin’?”</p>

<p>“Unc’ Nat,” Scilla continued with growing animation,
“ain’t you hyeah’d ’bout Tempe gittin’ drownded
in de street well, yonder by Miss Collamo
cawnder?”</p>

<p>“Great-day-in-de-mawnin’! gal,” Nat exclaimed.
“Is you come hyuh jokin’? Or is you tellin’ somh’n
w’at happen for-true?”</p>

<p>“I ain’ play’n, Unc’ Nat,” Scilla assured him.
“Tempe drownded yonder in de well. An’ nobody
ain’ know nothin’ ’tall ’bout it, till I comed along
soon dis mawnin’; an’ seen Tempe body floatin’ on
top de water, hol’in a bunch o’ stingin’-nettles,
tight-shet in one ’uh han’s; like she mus’ bin
grabbed ’um off de side de well w’en she was fallin’
in.”</p>

<p>Nat contemplated her face for a second, still doubting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the information. “Gal, go ’way,” he said to
her. “I bet you ain’ seen nothin’ but a bunch o’
weeds, or somh’n-nother floatin’ on top de water,
made you think ’twas Tempe body; dark like it
mus’ bin w’en you peeped in de well.”</p>

<p>But Scilla was positive about what she had seen,
she told him. Saying that she had started away
from home very early, on her way to Nat’s garden
after vegetables; and seeing the well uncovered
when she reached the corner, and fearing that someone
would meet with an accident; she stooped to
cover it. As she was putting the wooden lid in
place, a ray of sunlight, slanting through the opening,
attracted her attention to a strange-looking
object in the water. Getting down on her knees to
look at it more closely, she discovered that it was
Tempe’s body; with one arm pointing upward, and
the hand clutching a bunch of nettles.</p>

<p>“I was so sk’yeard, Unc’ Nat, I start to run an’
holler for help,” Scilla went on, with dramatic effect.
“W’en jus’ ’bout dat time, I seen Mr. Gully
baker wagon come ’roun de cawnder, an’ I call him
to come see.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gully got down off de wagon, an’ looked in
de well. An’ w’en he seen for hisself ’twas Tempe
body, he tol’ me go call somebody. So I went got
two or three mens; an’ dey all fetched a rope an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
things from Tempe yard; an’ dey commence strug’lin
wid de rope, till dey got it hitched roun’ Tempe
body. An’ aft’ a li’l w’ile, dey pulled ’uh up.</p>

<p>“Den dey all took Tempe to ’uh house; an’ I went
got some wimmins livin’ close-by, to look aft’ ’uh
an’ fix ’uh nice for de burryin’.... So aft’ I had
did all I could, I lef’ ’um all yonder, an’ come hyuh
to git my vegetables to carry over to New Leens to
sell.”</p>

<p>Nat looked at her in thoughtful contemplation.</p>

<p>“Nobody ain’ said nothin’ ’bout how Tempe come
to fall in de well?” He asked her.</p>

<p>“Some de people say ’twas a accident. An’ some
say Tempe bin so bad-off for so long, she was jus’
natchally weak-minded, an’ mus’ bin commit,”
Scilla advised him.</p>

<p>“I gotta go yonder dis evenin’, an’ see ’bout de
funeyun,” Nat murmured softly, as if talking to
himself. “Tempe ain’ got nothin’. An’ she bin too
good a ooman to leave dem don’-care-fied niggers
lay ’uh away, yonder in potter’s fiel’.”</p>

<p>“Tempe got life-in-sho-ince, Unc’ Nat,” Scilla informed
him. “One de wimmins foun’ de paper in
Tempe berow draw. An’ dey done sont word ’cross
de river to de Met-luh-policy man, to come see
’bout it befo’ dey take Tempe to de church.”</p>

<p>“Dat ain’ got nothin to do wid me,” Nat answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
abruptly. “Dis Tempe mule you see hitched to dis
harrow I’m fol’rin behin’ dis mawnin’. An’ de
secon’ payment ain’ made yet; an’ de money still
owin’ to ’uh. So Nat gotta go yonder to Gritny an’
do de right thing; an’ see dat Tempe laid away
like people. Not dumped in a hole like no-count
cattle.”</p>

<p>“Dey say dey lookin’ for de Met-luh-policy man to
git dah ’bout twelve o’clock,” Scilla told him. “So
Unc’ Nat, if you goin’ take charge de in-sho-ince
money, you better go yonder soon’s you kin.”</p>

<p>Nat looked at her with a scowl of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Gal, stop tellin’ me ’bout de Met-luh-policy man,”
he told her, sharply. “I ain’ got no business wid
none o’ Tempe in-sho-ince money. I’m goin’ yonder
wid Nat’s money.... Money w’at b’lonks to
Tempe, for dis mule you see stannin’ hyuh....
Money w’at goin’ puhvide de carriage for all dem
niggers to ride in; an’ give Tempe a good-lookin’
funeyun like people.... Da’s w’at Nat goin’
for.”</p>

<p>“Well, I sho wan’ try be dah w’en you come, Unc’
Nat,” Scilla assured him. “So come on, an’ gimme
my vegetables, an’ lemme go yonder an’ sell ’um,
an’ git thoo soon’s I kin.”</p>

<p>Scilla selected the vegetables she wanted, arranged
them in her basket, gave Nat the money for them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and put the basket on her head and left. As soon as
she had gone, Nat went back to his work.</p>

<p>“Come on hyuh, ole mule,” he called, taking up the
reins from the harrow and giving the mule a light
slap. “You gotta make quick tracks, an’ lemme git
thoo dese las’ few rows. ’Cause I wan’ hurry yonder
an’ take Tempe out de han’s o’ dem searchin’ niggers,
befo’ night come.... Git up hyuh, now. An’
lemme see you move like you un’stan w’at you
doin’; an’ got yo’ min’ on w’at Nat talkin’ ’bout....
You hyeah me?”</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter23">Carmelite had finished
another patch-work master-piece,—a “Jacob
ladder” pattern of many-colored gingham and calico
scraps; and being in need of money, she was
giving a “raffle meetin’” at her house. She said she
was sure to “take up five dollars ’munks all de
members w’at say dey was comin’.” Because cold
weather was not very far off; and people never
could have too many quilts. And ten cents a chance
was so little, she knew none of the members would
overlook the inducement. Besides, everybody was
bound to have a good time at Carmelite’s raffle,
“singin’ an’ jokin’ an’ drinkin’ coffee an’ eatin’
cake.” And rich cake, at that. The same kind Carmelite
made for the white folks’ table.</p>

</div>

<p>Duck eggs always made a cake taste better, she
declared with authority. They gave it such a fine
yellow color; and kept it from looking like “cheap
grocery-sto’ cake.” And Carmelite enjoyed hearing
her friends talk about it; and liked to hear
them “give ’uh de praise for ’uh cookin’.”</p>

<p>Nobody’s duck eggs were like Aunt Fisky’s. They
were always so big and fresh. And Carmelite knew
that she could get as many as she needed, in exchange
for anything she had to offer. Aunt Fisky
was too old to bend over and beat brick to sprinkle
on her floor; and Gussie was so busy running
around with the women, he never had time to stop
and sit down and pound it for her. So a bucket full
of brick dust was always a desirable article of barter.
A bundle of fat pine splinters for lighting the
fire was another thing to be desired; scarce as fat
pine was most of the time. And a pan of Carmelite’s
hot cornbread, almost as good as the cake she
made, was a thing Aunt Fisky would accept gladly,
in exchange for a half dozen duck eggs.</p>

<p>Having finished nearly all the preparations for the
evening raffle, Carmelite wrapped a newspaper
around a pan of hot cornbread just out of the oven,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and started away, after the duck eggs for the cake
she was going to make for her guests. She would
hurry back, she told herself; and the cake would
have time to get cool after she finished baking, and
it would “cut nice” for the frolic.</p>

<p>Half way across the green she met Aunt Fisky,
driving home her ducks from the pool of water
near her house. It was a wide stretch of ground in
the open green, where the earth had been dug away
during high water time, and carried off and banked
against a weak spot in the levee. Being near the
river, the pool was always filled with water and
crawfish; and it became a favorite resort of the
ducks, geese and colored children of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Coming up near the old woman, Carmelite greeted
her with a pleasant smile, saying:</p>

<p>“Aun’ Fisky, yo’ ducks sho look w’ite an’ healt’y
today.”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’ jew to look no yuther way, daughter,”
the old woman answered. “Plut’rin in de water like
dey is all day long from soon in de mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“You sho lucky to live so close by de pool out hyuh
whah de crawfish an’ bugs so plennyful,” Carmelite
went on. “It keep you from buyin’ a whole
lot o’ cawn an’ things for yo’ ducks. High as
chicken feed is dese days.... Dey sho is a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
flock o’ ducks, for being nothin’ but plain puddle
ducks. Ain’ dey?”</p>

<p>“Yas, daughter. Dey is healt’y an’ nice,” Aunt
Fisky answered. “But de ole ooman gittin’ too
feeble to be worry wid raisin’ ducks much longer.
You can’ keep ’um from stray’n off. An’ de crawfish
so temptin’ to ’um; dey looks like dey fo’gits
to come back home. So I has to go fetch ’um. An’
hyuh lately, I bin feelin’ so po’ly, it mos’ plays me
out to walk even fur as dis pool hyuh, ’cross de
green.”</p>

<p>“You ain’ got de rheumatism, is you?” Carmelite
asked, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“I ain’ sho, daughter,” Aunt Fisky replied, dubiously.
“But I bin rubbin’ my back an’ my two knees
wid some ni’ntment Unc’ Bendigo gimme; try’n to
see if it goin’ ease de miz’ry. But I ain’ notice no
change yet, since day-befo’-yistiddy.”</p>

<p>“Some kind o’ drug-sto’ n’intment?” Carmelite inquired.</p>

<p>“No. ’Tain’ nothin’ bought,” Aunt Fisky advised
her. “Somh’n Unc’ Bendigo bin makin’ to rub wid,
way yonder since Reb-time. Somh’n he say ain’
miss cu’in nobody ever bin use it. An’ so simple,
too,” she went on to explain. “’Tain nothin’ but
plain inch-worms out de groun’, mixed wid chop
pa’sley an’ a pinch o’ smokin’ tobacco, fried altogether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
in hog lard. An’ you gotta rub wid it in a
downwuds direction, to’ads de feet; so de miz’ry
pass out thoo de toes.”</p>

<p>“Sho soun’ like it mus’ be some kin to hoo-doo,”
Carmelite remarked, laughing.</p>

<p>“No it ’tain’,” Aunt Fisky corrected her. “Unc’
Bendigo don’ play wid no hoo-doo. It des a natchal
n’intment he say de ole folks learn ’im how to
make.”</p>

<p>“But w’at good it ’tis, if you say it ain’ help you
none?” Carmelite inquired.</p>

<p>“But how kin I say ’tain no good, if maybe I’m
usin’ de thing for somh’n I ain’ got?” the old woman
argued. “I ain’ sho dis no-count feelin’ I got
come from de rheumatism.”</p>

<p>“Maybe yo’ stummic is tight; an’ you needs purgin’,”
Carmelite suggested.</p>

<p>“Might be,” agreed Aunt Fisky; opening the gate,
and driving the ducks into the yard.</p>

<p>“Y’oughta eat you a few dese pumma-crissuls you
got hyuh in yo’ yard,” said Carmelite, pointing to a
castor oil bush in full fruit, growing along-side
the fence. “Dey sho physic you nice. An’ dey eats
good, too.”</p>

<p>Aunt Fisky stood silent, watching the line of ducks
marching on to the back yard. Seeing the newspaper
package in Carmelite’s hand, and guessing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the object of her visit, the old woman pushed the
door open and told her to go in.</p>

<p>Carmelite laid the pan of cornbread on the table
and sat down, looking about the room slowly. She
was impressed with the clean, orderly poverty of its
furnishing. Save for an old table and two chairs,
the place was almost bare. Some iron pots on the
hearth gave evidence that all the cooking was done
in the open fireplace, on the level with the floor,
and greatly in need of repairs.</p>

<p>Aunt Fisky drew a chair from the corner by the
chimney and sat down. Carmelite looked at her
without speaking, thinking of her tired old body
and the weary expression on her kindly wrinkled
old face. Her guinea-blue dress was patched in
many places, but was clean and carefully ironed.
Her head-handkerchief, once a bright piece of
yellow-and-brown plaid gingham, now old and
faded, was tied with care; the two tabs in front
drooping over like a tired butterfly resting after
a long flight.</p>

<p>“Daughter, I’m sho glad to set down,” Aunt Fisky
sighed, after a brief silence. “I’m so played-out till
I got de swimmin’ in de head.”</p>

<p>“Aun’ Fisky, yo’ stummic mus’ be ain’ workin’
right,” Carmelite advised her again. “W’at make
you don’ take a couple o’ dem pumma-crissul off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
de bush you got yonder, an’ eat ’um; an’ see if dey
don’ help you? Dey sho is good w’en somh’n be
wrong wid yo’ intwuds.” (Inwards.)</p>

<p>“Daughter, I know de things is good,” Aunt Fisky
answered; fully mindful of Carmelite’s well-meant
interest. “But I’m des natchally ’fraid to meddle
wid ’um,” she continued. “Ever since ole Unc’ Jo
Mingo died from eatin’ pumma-crissul seeds off
de bush in ’is yard.... I don’ trus’ ’um. So I don’
wan’ tamper wid ’um.”</p>

<p>“But, Aun’ Fisky, ain’t you b’lieve greed’ness had
a whole lot to do wid Unc’ Jo Mingo death?” Carmelite
asked her. “It look to me like pumma-crissul
kilt ’im ’cause he ain’ use no jedgment ’bout
eatin’ ’um,” she went on. “Ain’ sattafy eating two
or three seeds, w’en somebody tol’ ’im dey was good
for certain sickness; had to keep on eatin’ ’um, aft’
he done found out he like de way dey tas’e; till he
done et a <i>whole han’-full</i>.... ’Tain no wonder
Unc’ Jo Mingo died. Wid all dat castor oil surgin’
up an’ down ’is body.”</p>

<p>But Aunt Fisky’s judgment was going to be her
protection. She knew that palma Christi seeds were
good medicine. She had heard the white folks talk
about it, she told Carmelite. But she was afraid
to meddle with them, and would rather use some
remedy she knew better. Okra seed tea was just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
as good; and she would try a dose of that, if old
Uncle Bendigo’s ointment didn’t bring relief after
a few days more.</p>

<p>Carmelite advised her to be careful about what she
ate; and seized the occasion to call her attention to
the pan of corn-bread. Aunt Fisky got up and
unwrapped the present; thanked Carmelite for her
thoughtfulness, and asked her if she needed any
eggs. Carmelite told her about the raffle she was
giving; and said she wanted to bake a cake, and
would take a half dozen duck eggs, if Aunt Fisky
could spare them.</p>

<p>The old woman brought the eggs from the next
room; and after turning the cornbread out on the
table, she put the eggs in Carmelite’s pan, and sat
down again for a chat.</p>

<p>“Do Gussie know anything ’bout de raffle at yo’
house to-night?” Aunt Fisky inquired.</p>

<p>Carmelite hesitated slightly, uncertain what to answer.</p>

<p>“Gussie ’tenshun don’ run to’ads quilts, Aun’
Fisky. An’ da’s de reason I ain’ say nothin’ to
’im,” she apologized. “An’ innyway, de raffle ain’
goin’ las’ long. ’Cause you know, evvybody goin’
straight from my house, yonder to Tempe wake at
de New Hope church.... An’ I ’spec Gussie
goin’ too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“You done de right thing to leave Gussie out,”
Aunt Fisky told her. “Gussie ain’ fit to go no place;
all time drunk, like he bin lately. I dunno w’at
Gussie comin’ to. Runnin’ wid loose wimmins; an’
squand’in ’is money, gamblin’; an’ goin’ on reckless
like he doin’. Much as I bin tried to raise ’im
right. An’ done for ’im same’s he was my own chile
an’ my own color.”</p>

<p>“Might be Gussie goin’ make up ’is min’ an’ marry
Cindy, an’ settle down steady; now she done had
a chile by ’im,” Carmelite suggested.</p>

<p>“None de yuther mens bin had chillun by Cindy
ain’ thought nothin’ ’bout marryin’ Cindy, is dey?”
inquired the old woman, with a knowing smile.
“Who wan’ marry Cindy, trashy as she done made
’uhself all over Gritny?... I hyeah dem young
boys say: w’en dey see Cindy comin’ long de banquette,
dey crosses over to de yuther side de street,
to git out ’uh way. ’Cause dey say, all Cindy got to
do w’en she git close to you: des look at you <i>hard</i>,
an’ she have a chile by you befo’ you know it.”</p>

<p>Carmelite laughed heartily at the comment, saying
that people could talk as much as they pleased;
but Cindy didn’t pay no mind to what they said
about her, “good as she felt wid all dat fam’ly o’
gitlets” (illegitimates) to take care of her when
they grew up big enough to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>But Aunt Fisky said she didn’t agree with Cindy.
Cindy was saying the wrong thing. Children
changed when they grew up. They forgot all about
the old folks. They clean forgot all their parents
did for them, when they were crawling around helpless.
And when they reached the time of their
younger youth, and you had to give them every
kind of ’tention. Then, after they all growed big
enough to be some benefit, they turned their back
on the old folks, and went off and left them sitting
high and dry, waiting on the Lawd to provide for
them.</p>

<p>Look at Gussie. How much money did he bring in
the house to keep things going? The few stingy
dimes he put in her hand didn’t even pay for the
washing and patching of his clothes.—Let alone
all the cooking she had to do for him. But what did
he care? Long as he knew she had her ducks to
count on; and the few butterbeans and red peppers
in the garden, she could always sell to the white
folks; he wasn’t going to worry about her comfort.</p>

<p>“Who? Don’ tell me nothin’ ’bout raisin’ chillun
to be a sattafaction to you w’en you git ole,” she
ended with emphasis; Carmelite nodding her head
with perfect understanding.</p>

<p>Maybe Aunt Fisky was too easy-going, Carmelite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
told her. She ought to shame Gussie. And not let
him walk over her, long as he was staying under
her roof free. She ought to turn him out-doors, and
shame him good, and force him to show her the right
respect.</p>

<p>“But daughter, don’t you know Gussie ain’ no
<i>nigger</i>, like you an’ me?” Aunt Fisky reminded
her. “How you expec’ me to try an’ shame Gussie,
an’ make ’im know he ain’ doin’ de right thing?...
Gussie ain’ got no nigger feelin’s.... Gussie
a <i>w’ite</i> man. An’ he know it, too. So how kin I
change Gussie natchal ways?”</p>

<p>Carmelite moved on her chair uneasily, and began
to speak with sudden vehemence.</p>

<p>“Gussie ain’ <i>good</i> as a nigger!” she declared, stressing
every word as she spoke. “Bin livin’ munks
niggers all dese years, an’ now try’n to play proud
wid <i>you</i>, an’ ain’ got nothin’ substanshun to back
’im up?... Lookin’ down on you, ole as you is;
an’ de onles mother Gussie ever knowed?...
Gawd knows, Aun’ Fisky, you too tender-hearted.
You ain’ owin’ nothin’ to Gussie no longer; now he
done growed up, an’ plenny able to take care ’imself....
You done paid ’im evvything.... Who?...
Gussie lucky he ain’ had me to deal wid.
’Cause I sho would-a turned ’im out in de street
long time ago; w’ite or no w’ite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Aunt Fisky couldn’t do that, she told Carmelite.
It wouldn’t be right. It would be breaking the
promise she made with dead people; when Gussie’s
mother gave her the poor, fatherless child to raise.
And besides, Gussie had nobody but her to turn
to. No matter how mean he was, she couldn’t go
back on him. Carmelite knew good as she did that
the white folks wouldn’t recognize him.</p>

<p>“An’ I know good, none us niggers ain’ goin’ cunsider
claimin’ ’im,” Carmelite declared with positive
conviction.</p>

<p>“An’ da’s de very reason make me stick to Gussie
like I do,” Aunt Fisky assured her with simple
loyalty.</p>

<p>“Ole folks sho is strange,” Carmelite commented,
shaking her head, and wondering at the old woman’s
questionable sense of duty.</p>

<p>Yes. Old folks did a heap of things that young
folks couldn’t understand; she told Carmelite. But
she was going to do the best she could for Gussie,
as long as she lived. And if he came to a bad end,
she wouldn’t have anything to blame herself for.
She was willing to leave it all in the hands of the
Lawd. Gussie would wake up some day in his right
mind; when Gawd put His finger on him and
stopped him in his tracks. Carmelite would see.
Just wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe so,” Carmelite faltered, dubiously, getting
up from her chair and making ready to leave. “But
I sho don’ wan’ see ole no-manners Gussie come
lopin’ up in my house tonight,” she went on; taking
the pan of eggs from the table and walking
towards the door. “If he know w’at good for ’im,
he better stay ’way.... So I’m goin’ leave you
now; an’ go yonder an’ bake my cake.... An’
I’m goin’ pick you two lucky numbers, Aun’ Fisky;
an’ see’f I can’ make you win de quilt. You heah?”
she added in a cheerful tone, as she walked away;
leaving the old woman standing in the doorway,
looking pensively across the green.</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter24">Despite the fact of
Nookie’s being a sort of local joke, on account of
the peculiar clothes she often wore; there were a
few colored sisters of the East Green who showed
genuine respect for her ability as a dress-maker.
They spoke of her as a “natchal bawn seamster,”
when it came to transforming antique gowns and
“gabbarellas” donated by the white folks. And she
certainly knew how to make clothes “come to fit fat
people fine”.... Who? “Nookie sho could play
wid a needle an’ thread an’ scissors.” Nobody ever
need be afraid of getting a dress from Nookie
that would make her look like she had a “low back
an’ a high belly.” No indeed. Nookie was a “p’yo
fashion-plate” for making over old clothes. And
cheap, too; ’long-side the “boughten clo’se from the
dry-goods sto’.”</p>

</div>

<p>Eager to live up to this hard-earned reputation,
and pleased with the thought of being conspicuous
at Carmelite’s raffle, among the critical sisters of
the East Green, Nookie made herself a new dress
for the occasion. She had just finished the clever
contrivance; which, being creased and wrinkled
from many alterations, had to be pressed before it
could be worn.</p>

<p>Finding that she had no charcoal to make a fire in
the furnace, she decided to run over to Soongy’s
house and press it there. Soongy was going to the
raffle; and Nookie was sure that she would be ironing
something for herself to wear that night. So
putting the dress in a market basket, Nookie
started off across the green, humming softly as she
hurried along.</p>

<p>When she came to Soongy’s house, the gate was
open; and the sound of singing inside told her that
someone was at home. There were two voices singing,
and the sound was cheerful and pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
Nookie recognized the voices of Soongy and Dink.
There was no need to call. They wouldn’t hear.
She would walk right in.</p>

<p>Going into the kitchen, she found Soongy at
work at the ironing-board, pressing a voluminous,
well-starched petticoat; an old faded curtain
spread on the floor under the board to keep the
trailing garment from getting soiled.</p>

<p>Dink was standing at the kitchen table, washing
dishes; naked as though he had just emerged from
the bath. Both of them were singing in unison,
tranquilly happy; and apparently oblivious to each
other’s presence.</p>

<p>Nookie stood in speechless amazement for a few
seconds, wondering at the unusual spectacle;
neither of the singers having noticed her quiet
entrance. At length she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“In de name o’ Gawd, Soongy! W’at kind o’
fashion dis is, y’all got hyuh? Stannin’ hyuh oncuncern’
singin’ Gawd praise; an’ Dink purradin’
in front you naked as a black snake. None y’all ain’
feel shame?... Boy, go yonder an’ wrap somh’n
’round yo’ middle, befo’ you come facin’ people so
haphazzud,—big as you is!”</p>

<p>Not waiting to hear all of Nookie’s speech, Dink
ran into the next room, laughing heartily. Soongy
continued to slide her iron back and forth over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
petticoat on the board, unperturbed. Looking at
Nookie, she said casually:</p>

<p>“Nookie, you sho know how to come up on people
easy. W’at make you ain’ call, so somebody kin
know you comin’?”</p>

<p>“W’at good callin’ goin’ do?” Nookie asked her.
“You an’ Dink up in hyuh together, singin’ so boist’ous?
Wid yo’ min’ workin’ so heavy on dat i’nin-boad;
I reckon you ain’ took time to notice Dink
walkin’ ’roun hyuh in ’is naked skin, till I had to
call yo’ ’tenshun to it. Is you?”</p>

<p>With calm politeness, Soongy said:</p>

<p>“Nookie, you ain’ got to gimme no egvice cuncernin’
Dink. I know de boy was naked. An’ he
know he gotta stay naked, too. ’Till I git good an’
ready to give ’im ’is clo’se, from whah I done hid
’um.”</p>

<p>Nookie looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“W’at you mean?” she inquired. “Da’s de way you
punishes Dink to make ’im stay in-do’s?”</p>

<p>“Da’s de onles way I know how to keep Dink from
goin’ yonder in de swamp, play’n munks dem shoe-pick
ditches,” Soongy went on to explain. “Times
an’ times, I done tol’ Dink I don’ never eat no
nasty shoe-pick. But he so hard-head. He steal off
evvy chance he git; an’ go yonder in de swamp, wid
Mahaley chillun an’ some dem yuther hongry li’l<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
A-rabs from down de street. Comin’ back hyuh at
night, wid a sack full o’ dirty ole shoe-pick feesh;
expec’in me to cook ’um.... Like he ain’ never
bin use to nothin’ ’tall good to eat.”</p>

<p>Nookie looked at her with a feeling of mingled
disappointment and disgust. Was Soongy trying
to put on airs with her, and make believe she didn’t
eat tchoupique? A fish she was raised on; like all
the other poor colored folks living close to the
swamp. A fish so fat and greasy, and so plentiful in
all the muddy bayous and ditches, that everybody
called it “Gawd’s feesh.” Something Gawd provided
for His nigger people, to keep them in food
when everything else failed. A fish that all the
swamp niggers caught in the long summer time,
and cut up and salted and dried in the sun; and
hung up in their kitchens to last through the winter,
when they couldn’t afford to buy fresh meat.
And you didn’t have to catch them with a line,
like you did other fish, either. All the children had
to do when they went to the tchoupique pond: take
a flour barrel, and knock out the two heads. Then,
just “plump” it down in the water hard. And you
never missed having ’most a barrel half-full, ready
to scoop up with your hands, and throw out on the
bank.</p>

<p>Thinking of the unctuous court-bouillon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
tchoupique stew she knew how to make, Nookie
asked:</p>

<p>“Soongy, you say you don’ eat shoe-pick?”</p>

<p>“Who?” answered Soongy, with a superior air. “I
jus’ as soon eat lamp-eel, as eat dat nasty slimy
mud feesh. No ’ndeed, not me.”</p>

<p>“I eats ’um, Miss Nookie,” sounded Dink’s pleasant
announcement, as he came in from the next
room; a pillow slip tied around his middle with a
string.</p>

<p>He went over to the table quietly and began washing
the dishes. Soongy looked at him crossly, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Boy! W’at in de name o’ Gawd you mean? Takin’
my nice clean pilluh slip off de bed, to splash it all
up wid greasy dish water?... Go yonder in de
room, an’ take dat pilluh slip off yo’ black body,
an’ put it back whah it b’lonks; befo’ I stomps bofe
yo’ livers down an’ beats you speechless!... You
hyeah me?”</p>

<p>Dink looked at her appealingly and left the room.</p>

<p>“W’at make you don’ leave de boy put on ’is clo’se,
Soongy?” Nookie asked, rebukingly. “Ain’ he
gotta go yonder to Carmelite house wid you tonight,
to play de comb an’ make music for de raffle?”</p>

<p>“You leave Dink be,” Soongy advised her, curtly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
“Dink got plenny time to put on ’is clo’se befo’ he
go to Carmelite house. Dis now. Tonight ain’ come
yet.”</p>

<p>Not being in sympathy with Soongy’s views,
Nookie was ready to argue in Dink’s behalf.</p>

<p>“Soongy, w’at make you wan’ be so hard on Dink
like you is; w’en all he doin’, is try’n to be decen’?”
She asked. “You think mo’ ’bout yo’ pilluh slip
gittin’ spoilt, den you does ’bout de boy ketchin’
’is death o’ col’; runnin’ ’roun hyuh in ’is naked
skin, wid all dis draf’ searchin’ over ’is body. You
sho oughta be ’shame’.”</p>

<p>Soongy looked up from her ironing, and answered
impatiently:</p>

<p>“Dink ain’ fraid no draf’ blowin’ ove’ ’im, out yonder
in de swamp wid dem chillun; w’en he pull off
’is clo’se an’ jump in de ditch wid a ba’l to ketch
shoe-pick, is he?... An’ inny-way, you ain’ need
to gimme no egvice ’bout Dink,” she went on, with
animation. “If da’s all you come hyuh for,—to
raise de subjec’ cuncernin’ w’at I has to do wid
Dink; you gotta ’scuze me if I tell you, you welcome
to go back home de same way you come hyuh. An’
no hard feelin’s, either.”</p>

<p>“I ain’ come hyuh to meddle you,” Nookie apologized.
“I come hyuh to press dis dress I wan’ wear
to Carmelite raffle tonight. I ain’ had no charcoal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
my house, an’ I say you mus’ bin had fire in de
funnish; so I took my dress an’ come hyuh to do
my pressin’.... But you ain’ mind, is you?” She
asked, falteringly.</p>

<p>“De i’ons an’ de fire an’ de funnish all hyuh. An’
you kin press as much as you please,” Soongy answered;
putting her work aside and clearing the
board for Nookie. “I ain’ min’ nothin’. ’Cep w’en
people try to make me feel cheap befo’ chillun,”
she went on. “Wan’ make me think I gotta eat
shoe-pick, jus’ ’cause Dink bring ’um hyuh an’ ax
me to cook ’um.”</p>

<p>Nookie laughed pleasantly, and said:</p>

<p>“Soongy, nobody ain’ wan’ fo’ce you to eat shoe-pick
if you scawns ’um so critical. Nex’ time Dink
bring a mess o’ feesh home, you jes’ sen’ ’um roun’
to my house; an’ I bet I show you how to perish
’um. Who? I’m a plum fool w’en it come to
mixin’-up shoe-pick an’ tomattusus an’ seas’nin an’
things.... An’ Dink, you kin fill up yo’ plate
many time as you want,” she called to him, in his
hiding place. “So bring de things roun’ to me, you
hyeah?”</p>

<p>The sound of Dink’s pleased giggle echoed from
the next room, and Soongy said to Nookie, loud
enough for Dink to hear:</p>

<p>“Come on hyuh, Nookie, an’ git thoo pressin’ yo’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
dress, an’ go home an’ lemme straighten up hyuh.
An’ stop puttin’ devilment in dat boy head....
Nex’ time Dink go yonder ketchin’ shoe-pick, I lay
I’m goin’ fix ’im so, he go naked till de Lawd has
to take pity on ’im, an’ give ’im clo’se to put on. I
sho Gawd will. If I has to burn evvy scat’rin rag he
got to ’is name.”</p>

<p>Nookie walked over to the furnace, and taking one
of the irons from the fire, she spat on it to test the
heat. As she began pressing her dress, she said:</p>

<p>“Soongy, you ain’ foolish, no. Good as you know
how to make b’lieve you is.”</p>

<p>Ignoring the remark, Soongy went to the table and
fell to washing the dishes which Dink left in the
pan. Very soon, song took the place of conversation;
and the two women worked on, singing cheerfully
over their tasks. Now and then the wavering
sound of Dink’s voice came from the next room,
like a broken response.</p>

<p>Nookie finished pressing her dress, folded it carefully,
and put it in the basket, making ready to
go.</p>

<p>“Now I’m goin’ yonder to my house, an’ lay down
till dis evenin’,” she said to Soongy, after thanking
her for the use of her charcoal and irons. “An’
watch how you goin’ see me strut in dis new frock
tonight, w’en I git to Carmelite house, in front all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
dem people say dey comin’,” she called back as she
walked out. “An’ leave Dink put on ’is clo’se, so he
kin come soon an’ play music on de comb, an’ make
dem niggers feel good befo’ dey go yonder to
Tempe wake.”</p>

<p>The prolonged quiet in the next room seemed to
tell Soongy that Dink had fallen asleep. As soon as
Nookie had gone, Soongy called to him commandingly:</p>

<p>“Boy! You better come in dis kitchen an’ wipe dese
dishes, an’ help me straighten-up dis room, befo’
you commence thinkin’ ’bout puttin’ on inny clo’se
to go ’way from hyuh tonight. You hyeah me?”</p>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter25">All afternoon fast-moving
banks of dark threatening clouds were
hovering over the East Green, and with the coming
of evening the rain began falling in torrents. Gussie
had just finished his supper of cornbread and
coffee before the open fireplace, and was sitting
watching the puffs of smoke the wind blew down
the chimney, and listening to the pelting sound of
the rain on the old shingle roof. He wondered how
he would be able to go out if the rain continued;
remembering that it was the night he had to help
old man Hooblitz with his sausage-making. Rain
or no rain, he had to go. Because his word was his
bond; and he knew that the old man would expect
him.</p>

</div>

<p>Aunt Fisky was sitting by the table, patching one
of Gussie’s old cottonade shirts by the dim light of
a flickering candle. She saw him get up and go to
the door and look out, and knew by his manner that
he was impatient to get away. She felt that it would
be useless to try and hinder him. It would only
make him cross.</p>

<p>Putting on his hat and coat, he told her good night
and started off in the rain. He would go to Mr.
Cholly Groos’s and get a cup of lemon-gin first, he
told himself; then go down to old man Hooblitz’s
and hurry and get through; and after that “go by
an’ peep in at Carmelite’s raffle for a w’ile.” And
after that, go to the church and sing over Tempe
till he got tired. Then, after a full night of varied
pleasures, he would go home to Aunt Fisky, and
“lay down, an’ sleep de sleep o’ de sattafied.”</p>

<p>This singular old German with the effervescent
name, was a woodcutter by day; who, requiring
extra funds for the desired supply of beer and
whiskey for selfish consumption, against swamp-fever,
snake-bites and such-like evils, managed to
overcome the need by following the craft of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
sausage-making at night. His retired laboratory
was a small shanty on the edge of Ziffle’s Wood,
adjoining the cemetery. Hooblitz cut down the
trees for Mr. Ziffle, who furnished the villagers
with cord wood for their cook stoves and fireplaces.</p>

<p>Owing to a series of harsh disagreements with his
married daughter who thought not highly of her
father’s spectacular inebriety; old Hooblitz lived
alone at his sausage factory on Mr. Ziffle’s property.
Occasionally Gussie went to help him with the
sausage-making; often spending the night with
him, and taking part in his deep potations and
raucous revelling; when only the owls in the cypress
trees and the bullfrogs in the near-by canal would
be annoyed by the seeming rivalry.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the place where the sausage was
made could not be called a room. It was nothing
more than a tin roof supported by four posts,
young cypress trees with the bark on. The floor was
of mud, baked hard from the fire that burned in
the center three nights of each week. Over the fire
was a large three-legged cauldron, with a brick
under each foot. In it was boiled the mixture he
peddled in a basket, going about in the evening
from door to door; no distinction being made between
his white and colored patrons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Adjoining the place where he worked,—fastened
on like a casual after-thought, was the room in
which he slept. Its furnishings consisted of a rude
bunk nailed to the wall; a long cypress tool chest
resting on a pair of tressels; a soap box and a beer
keg, to serve the purpose of chairs for any chance
visitors. By way of decoration, the walls were hung
with old hats, coats and trousers; here and there,
odd pieces of red flannel shirts and underwear adding
a redeeming note of cheer to the dull squalor of
the place. The most striking thing, however, was an
array of empty flasks and bottles (eloquent reminders
of the revels of the past) hanging by
strings from the rafters overhead.</p>

<p>For a long time Mr. Ziffle had the feeling that his
woodpiles were being rifled, gently but systematically.
He discussed the fact with old Hooblitz,
who, not only gave vent to friendly indignation;
but expressed his willingness to act as night-watchman
and shoot the unworthy rogue, regardless of
caste or color.</p>

<p>But his enthusiasm did not succeed in removing
suspicion from Mr. Ziffle’s mind. He was convinced
that Hooblitz was the crafty pilferer. So he determined
to put the matter to a test. Whereupon
he took a dozen or more sticks of wood and bored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
them full of gimlet holes; into which he poured a
small quantity of gunpowder, plugging them up
afterward. Then he placed the loaded cord sticks
on the tops of the various woodpiles, and sat down
patiently to wait results.</p>

<p>The night set in with a driving rain, just as old
Hooblitz lighted his fire and filled the big iron pot
with the ingredients for the unsanitary brew he
would peddle as sausage. Looking at his supply of
wood, he saw there was not enough to finish the
boiling, and that he would have to pay a secret
visit to Mr. Ziffle’s woodpile to get a few sticks to
last the night. He was just about to go out, when
the door flew open suddenly, and Gussie lunged
into the room, dripping wet and blowing like a
porpoise.</p>

<p>Displeased with the untimely interruption, and not
wanting Gussie to find out the secret of his wood
supply, knowing that he would speak of it in the
village and Mr. Ziffle would hear it eventually; old
Hooblitz stood looking at the unwelcome visitor,
leering at his discomfort with a sort of malicious
delight. Gussie sat down dejectedly on the beer
keg, beating his wet cap against its side. The old
man continued to laugh, wondering at the same
time how long he would have to wait before going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
about his work. Getting up slowly, Gussie shook
himself several times, like a wet dog trying to dry
himself.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Mr. Hooblitz,” he began to complain,
“I ain’ see w’at you got to laugh at. If I
had knowed ’twas goin’ rain like dis, I sho would
’a stayed ’way from hyuh tonight.... You ain’
goin’ make no sausage, bad weather like dis, is
you?”</p>

<p>’Twasn’t raining on the inside; the old man told
him curtly. He didn’t have to stay, if he wanted to
go back home; the old man went on. He got along
without help before; he could get along without it
again. Little bit of rain didn’t make him afraid to
work for an honest living. The house had a roof
over it. And there was a good fire, in the bargain.</p>

<p>“Li’l bit o’ rain!” Gussie exclaimed; surprised at
his disagreeable manner of talking. “Man, you ain’
seen de water fallin’ out-do’as, if you wan’ call dat
a li’l bit o’ rain.... Look how I’m soaked clean
thoo to de skin, if you ain’ b’lieve w’at I’m tellin’
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, w’at you want me to do?” The old man
asked indifferently, with a flat harsh drawl.</p>

<p>“Gimme li’l somh’n to drink,” Gussie told him
frankly. “Li’l somh’n to warm me up befo’ I start
’way from hyuh. ’Cause I ain’ goin’ stay wid you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
an’ do no work tonight.... I done already seen
whah you too cross an’ crabby for me to stay hyuh
an’ play ’roun’ dis sausage pot. Wet as I done got
comin’ ’way down hyuh in de woods for
nothin’.... An’ inny-way, I got to go yonder to
Carmelite raffle an’ see’f I can’ win’ one dem quilts
for Aun’ Fisky.... An’ got to go yonder to
Tempe wake, too.... So gimme a drink o’
somh’n-nother, Mr. Hooblitz, so I kin leave hyuh
w’en it slack-up rainin’ a li’l bit out-do’as.”</p>

<p>The old man took a flask from his pocket, and holding
it out to Gussie, said roughly:</p>

<p>“Here. Take a drink. An’ I hope it lands you in
Hell before morning.... An’ hurry on back to
your damn niggers; if that’s what you want to do.
I reckon I kin git along good enough by myself.”</p>

<p>Gussie looked at the flask; then contemplated the
old man’s face for a second before answering.</p>

<p>“But no, Mr. Hooblitz. You sho is cross tonight....
W’as de matter? You begrudge me a li’l bit
o’ licker to keep me from ketchin’ col’, wet as I’m
is? An’ come hyuh to help you, too?... Hyuh,
take yo’ licker back,” he went on, holding out the
flask to the old man. “I ain’ got to drink it, if da’s
de way you wan’ talk. Frien’ly as me an’ you bin
for so long.”</p>

<p>Old Hooblitz took the flask, and after helping himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
to a long swig, he handed it back to Gussie,
saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t be so damn touchy about your niggers. Take
your drink, an’ go on back to ’um. You might miss
the excitement if you stay here too long.”</p>

<p>Gussie put the flask to his mouth and took a long
pull. He handed it back and the old man put it
in his pocket and sat down sullenly. Gussie shook
himself in his wet clothes, put on his cap, buttoned
his coat well about his neck, and started for the
door. He looked out to see if the rain had abated.</p>

<p>“’Tain drappin’ so hard like it ’twas,” he said,
turning to the old man. “But ’tain no use stay’n
hyuh no longer. So Mr. Hooblitz, I’m goin’ tell
you good-night.”</p>

<p>The old man made an inarticulate grunt as Gussie
left, calling to him as the door closed:</p>

<p>“Damn you an’ your good-night! I don’t care if I
never see you no more.”</p>

<p>Going over to the bunk, he lifted the straw mattress
and brought out a quart bottle of whiskey.
He filled the empty flask he had in his pocket, took
a generous gulp, put the flask back, and looked
out at the weather.</p>

<p>The rain was falling in torrents.</p>

<p>He would have to go out after the wood, as the fire
was burning very low. Going over to the array of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
clothing on the wall, he took an old coat from the
peg, threw it over his shoulders and started out in
search of the woodpile. After stumbling through the
dark, he came back after a while with four sticks of
wood, his clothing thoroughly drenched.</p>

<p>“A good dram’ll warm up the inside, an’ I’ll be dry
in no time,” he said to reassure himself, lifting his
flask and drinking heartily. Then he raked the fire
together and put on two sticks of wood, and went
into his room to lie down until the cooking required
further attention.</p>

<p>The rain pelted on the tin roof of the shed and the
ringing sound went echoing through the room like
a savage serenade. The malodorous fumes of the
boiling pot also went into the room, bringing him
visions of profitable sales and more comforting
flasks for the lonely nights to follow. The thought
made him happy, so he took another long drink of
thankfulness; closing his eyes so as not to be
shocked by the dismal aspect of an empty bottle.</p>

<p>The rain rattled and the fire cracked, but nothing
disturbed the pleasure of his dreaming. The pot
gurgled and the fire cracked louder than before, but
the rude noise failed to penetrate the chaotic lethargy
that wrapped his maudlin mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gunpowder exploded, sending the
loaded cord sticks flying in every direction; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
seething pot soaring into the air against the tin
roof, rattling like a charge of light artillery; the
heterogeneous contents, scattered to the four winds
like the spoils of battle.</p>

<p>But old Hooblitz heard no sound. No hint of the
loud catastrophe. He lay unmoved on his dingy
bed, wrapped in a fringe of bibulous ecstasy; half-hidden
in the reek of steam that filled the room; oblivious
to all mundane things; until the coming of
morning confronted him with the cruel truth, and
the accusing presence of Mr. Ziffle, asking if he
was ready to deliver the culprit to justice.</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-g.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter26">Gussie went stumbling
along the muddy street through the rain, wondering
how soon he would come to a shed under
which he could take momentary shelter. The nearest
one was Mr. Honnus’s bar-room. He could see
the pale gleam of lamplight reaching out across the
street in the distance, but the welcome reflection was
still several blocks away. He hurried on, quarreling
with himself for going on such a wild goose chase,
and cursing old Hooblitz for sending him off in the
rain with so little consideration.</p>

</div>

<p>When he reached Mr. Honnus’s shed, he sat down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
on the door-step, deliberating whether to go in and
have a drink to warm him up; or to continue right
on to Carmelite’s house and dry his clothes by her
kitchen stove before the raffle started.</p>

<p>He came to a decision without long delay. The bar-room
door opened, and Chicken-Volsin coming out,
Gussie had to get up to let him pass. Seeing
Gussie’s wretched condition, Chicken-Volsin exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Great Gawd, man! Whah you come from? You
look like somebody bin wollin’ in de ditch....
Come inside wid me an’ git somh’n to drink.”</p>

<p>“Sho Gawd will,” Gussie answered, well-pleased.
“’Cause I feel like I’m ’bout to git de chills; wid all
dis col’ rain searchin’ ’round my body.”</p>

<p>“Whah in de name o’ Gawd you bin, Gussie?” Volsin
asked in amazement; walking over to the bar and
calling for whiskey.</p>

<p>Gussie gave him a brief account of his useless journey
to old Hooblitz’ place; the unfriendly manner
in which he had been treated; and his determination
to get to Carmelite’s raffle that night, rain or no
rain. Anybody that had a spare dime could go and
take a chance. And he had his mind set on winning
one of Carmelite’s quilts for Aunt Fisky; so he
would go, if he had to swim there.</p>

<p>Chicken-Volsin tried to shame him about his appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
but Gussie assured him that he could sit
by Carmelite’s stove and dry out before he went in
the front room “munks de people.”</p>

<p>“Some mens sho is foolish ’bout goin’ wid wimmins,”
Volsin twitted.</p>

<p>“’Tain’ de wimmins takin’ me to Carmelite house,”
Gussie explained. “It’s dem quilts she rafflin’....
I ain’ give Aun’ Fisky nothin’ for so long, I wan’
bring ’uh home somh’n nice to make up for it....
An’ two or three dimes ain’ goin’ break nobody. So
da’s w’at I’m goin’ for.”</p>

<p>Chicken-Volsin accepted the excuse without further
comment, and offered him another friendly drink.
Gussie swallowed the whiskey with relish, and
seeming to have forgotten his discomfort, started
to go.</p>

<p>Chicken-Volsin walked to the door with him and
saw him go out in the rain. He stood watching him
running across the street, and laughed to think what
a fool Gussie was, exposing himself to such weather
“for nothin’ but one li’l ole raggedy quilt.”</p>

<p>On reaching Carmelite’s house, Gussie pushed the
gate open hurriedly, and ran up the steps, stamping
his feet loudly on the gallery, trying to dry
them. Carmelite was in the kitchen, and hearing
the strange noise, she came out to see who had arrived.
As she entered the room, the front door flew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
open unceremoniously, and she saw Gussie lunge
into the room; his shoes covered with mud, and rillets
of water running from his clothing and dripping
from his cap, all over her neat, well-scrubbed
floor.</p>

<p>She looked at him, filled with consternation, struggling
for appropriate speech.</p>

<p>“Look! ole ugly w’ite nigger.... Is you done los’
yo’ good mind?” She almost shouted. “W’at you
<i>mean</i>, comin’ up in my house dis-away?... Wettin’
up all my funnuchuh, an’ trackin’ dirt all ove’
my nice clean flo’ wid yo’ big ole muddy shoes?...
<i>Git</i> out o’ hyuh an’ go whah you b’long!... Nobody
ain’ ax you to come hyuh, no-how.”</p>

<p>“Carmelite, don’ holluh at me like dat,” Gussie appealed
to her quietly. “Lemme git to de kitchen an’
set by de stove, an’ git dry befo’ people start to
come an’ ketch me lookin’ like dis.... Mizabul as
you see me hyuh, wid all dese wet clo’se on.”</p>

<p>“<i>Who?</i>” Carmelite shouted with indignation. “You
ain’ think you goin’ stay hyuh tonight an’ go munks
people, trampy-lookin’ an’ lavadated as you is?...
Who?... Gussie, you mus’ be a fool!... So
you better make up yo’ min’ to go ’way from hyuh
right now; an’ no mo’ talkin’ ’bout it.... You
hyeah w’at I say?”</p>

<p>Gussie looked at her dejectedly, wondering whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
to go or stay. He tried to reason with her, telling
her that he only wanted to get dry before going
out again; that was all. She wouldn’ have the heart
to turn him out in the rain, after he came all the way
from the woods to take a few chances just to help
her out? Nobody would turn a dog out-doors a night
like that. He wouldn’ bother anybody out in the
kitchen all by himself. Who would care anything
about him, as long as they were having a good time
in the front of the house?</p>

<p>Taking a half dollar out of his pocket, he held it out
to Carmelite saying:</p>

<p>“Hyuh; take dis fo’-bits, an’ pick some good numbers,
an’ see’f you can’ win de quilt for me; so I kin
take it yonder to Aun’ Fisky.”</p>

<p>Carmelite took the coin without a demur. It was an
unexpected ameliorating charm. A welcome token
of truce.</p>

<p>“Come on out hyuh an’ set to de stove; so I kin
hurry up an’ wipe dese tracks off dis flo’ befo’ innybody
git hyuh,” Carmelite said in a quiet voice,
starting for the kitchen with Gussie following her.
“An’ ’tain no pity for <i>you</i> make me change my
min’; no,” she went on. “If ’twasn’ say I know Aun’
Fisky so long; an’ know w’at she got to put up wid;
I <i>sho</i> would make you take de road tonight; brazen
as you is, comin’ hyuh like dis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>Gussie pulled a chair close to the stove and sat
down; glad to get where it was warm, and thankful
to be under shelter at last. Carmelite took a floor-cloth
from behind the door and went to the front
room to wipe up the mud tracks from Gussie’s
shoes. After a while she came back; and seeing
Gussie looking at the coffee pot on the stove, she
said:</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ give you a cup o’ coffee; an’ you stay
hyuh an’ drink it. An’ don’t you come to de front
w’en people git hyuh, an’ de raffle be goin’ on in
yonder. You hyeah?”</p>

<p>Gussie told her that he would stay in the kitchen.
All he wanted was to get dry. And maybe after he
drank his coffee, he would go to sleep for a little
while, before he passed by Tempe’s wake, on his
way home.</p>

<p>“Well, you stay hyuh in de kitchen,” Carmelite reminded
him. “An’ if inny one yo’ numbers draw de
quilt, I’ll fetch it out hyuh to you.”</p>

<p>She poured a cup of coffee and placed it on the
apron of the stove for him. Hearing voices at the
front, she went to look after her guests; leaving
Gussie to take his enjoyment as he felt inclined.</p>

<p>When Carmelite came into the room, Scilla was
standing in the middle of the floor unpinning herself
from the folds of an old gray blanket. Mozella<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
was sitting in the rocking-chair, wiping her bare
feet with a towel, and making ready to put on her
shoes and stockings, which she had carried in her
hand. Pinkey was leaning against the door, hesitating
to come in, for fear of leaving mud tracks on
the floor.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows, Carmelite,” she remarked half-regretfully,
“you sho picked out a nasty night to
make people come ’way from home, an’ bring a
whole lot o’ mud an’ confusion in yo’ house,—jus’
for one quilt.”</p>

<p>Carmelite gave an unconcerned laugh and told her
not to worry about the mud. She had plenty of rags
and soap to clean it up tomorrow. She wasn’t too
old and feeble to get down on her two knees to
scrub. ’Specially after people had come so well-meanin’
to help her make a few dimes, to pay for all
the sewin’ she put on that nice Jacob-ladder quilt
she was goin’ leave ’um to view later on. No indeed....
A little bit of mud tracks wouldn’t upset her,
if the crowd was goin’ to be plennyful.</p>

<p>Keziah came in, followed by Frozine who was carrying
a lantern; her skirt tucked up above her
knees; her white stockings and battered pair of
loose-fitting men’s shoes giving her a most ludicrous
appearance.</p>

<p>Soongy and Lethe were sitting in the corner, staring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
at her in amused silence. Dink was standing
across the room, looking at her with his hand over
his mouth, struggling to keep back a convulsive
outbreak.</p>

<p>Carmelite went to take the lantern from Frozine,
saying:</p>

<p>“Frozine, you come clean from home all thoo de
street like dis? Wid a lantun shinin’ ginse yo’ laigs
so brazen? Callin’ people tenshun to you, crittacul-lookin’
as you is?”</p>

<p>Who? Frozine remarked with a fine indifference.
She didn’t have people to study about.... She
didn’t play with mud in the day-time; so she knew
good and well that she wasn’t going to take no
chances with any Gritny mud in the night-time.... Fallin’
down in the dark and wreckin’ herself,
without a lantern.... No indeed.... People
laughin’ didn’t worry her. They could laugh at her
legs as much as they pleased. Laughin’ couldn’t
hurt her feelings.... But she sure Gawd was going
to look to keep her legs from getting hurt....
Yes indeed.... Because she had too many things
she had to do, before she “runned up on a accident
an’ come to be a cripple befo’ her time.”</p>

<p>“Hyuh Bennee done come, Carmelite. An’ got
Duckery wid ’im, too,” Soongy called to her as she
went back with Frozine’s lantern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>The two young men came in smiling to everyone
present, and the buzz of conversation and merry
laughter began to fill the room.</p>

<p>Carmelite came back with the Jacob-ladder quilt
and spread it over a chair for examination. The
women commented on the bright colors, and admired
the beauty of the pattern, and praised Carmelite
for the fine work she had done. Carmelite
thanked them for coming, and told them she wanted
everybody to have a good time.</p>

<p>“How long y’all expec’in to stay hyuh?” Duckery
asked with playful impatience. “You goin’ stay
hyuh all night an’ cackle like a passul o’ guinea-hens?...
Done forgot ’bout Tempe waitin’ for
y’all to do some singin’ ove’ ’uh, yonder to de
church?... Y’all better git started an’ do w’at
you wan’ do; if you wan’ git finish an’ go to inny
wake tonight.”</p>

<p>“Das jus’ w’at I say, Duckery. You sho right,”
Soongy agreed. “W’at Carmelite waitin’ for, innyway?
Maybe de bad weather keepin’ de members
from comin’.... Look to me like dey got enough
hyuh already to go ’head wid de intuhprize....
Evvybody w’at done took a chance on de quilt ain’
got to be hyuh to see de thing go thoo, is dey?”</p>

<p>No. They didn’t have to wait any longer; Carmelite
answered. She would start things going right away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Calling to Dink, she told him to make music on the
comb so all would be lively. He began playing a
merry time, and the spirit of cheer and good fellowship
went floating about the room.</p>

<p>Carmelite took from the table a cardboard shoe box
containing the blanks and numbered slips for the
raffle, and asked Duckery if he would call out the
numbers. He put the numbered slips in his hat and
the blanks in Bennee’s hat; and after clapping his
hands for attention, he said:</p>

<p>“If dey got innybody hyuh ain’t picked a number
for dis raffle, dey better come on now an’ choose; so
we kin put ’um all in de hat together, an’ leave
Bennee commence shakin’ ’um up. ’Cause you know
dis thing gotta go thoo straight like a lotry....
Square deal to evvybody, ’dout inny prefyun.”
(Preference.)</p>

<p>Each member present had a number; and Carmelite
had the list with their names “marked-up on de
paper.” They were all sure that the drawing would
be fair and square. Duckery would call the numbers
and Bennee would handle the blanks.</p>

<p>Dink’s harmonious comb was playing a pleasant
obligato as the drawing began, and all eyes were
looking on with eager expectation.</p>

<p>“Number foteen!” Duckery called out, taking the
slip from the hat with a flourish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“Nothin’ ain’ wrote on dis’n,” Bennee informed
him, unfolding the blank and examining it on both
sides.</p>

<p>Duckery looked at him with an ominous scowl, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Ole country nigger, ain’t you never took part in a
raffle befo’?... Dat ain’ de way you gotta call
back to me w’en I calls out de number.... If dey
ain’ got nothin’ on de paper, all you gotta say to
me is <i>Blank</i>.... ’Till you picks out de paper got
<i>Prize</i> marked-up on it.... Now go ’head, an’
do de thing right.... An’ lissen good so you kin
un’stan’ de numbers w’en I calls ’um.”</p>

<p>“Da’s right, Duckery,” came Carmelite’s earnest
approval. “You make dis thing go thoo straight.
’Cause I don’ wan’ have none y’all niggers say I had
dese numbers fixed-up befo’ han’. An’ say I robbed
’um out a dime, ’cause dey ain’ had de luck to win
de quilt.”</p>

<p>“I know you ain’ talkin’ to me,” she heard Scilla’s
sharp staccato call out. “I know I ain’ goin’ bother
my good self ’bout raisin’ no trouble over one li’l ole
dry dime I done paid out on any quilt.”</p>

<p>“Number nine,” Duckery called in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“Dis’n blank, too,” Bennee answered innocently.</p>

<p>Duckery rolled his eyes and glared at him intently,
while everybody laughed at Bennee’s forgetfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Number fifty-two,” Duckery called, fixing his
gaze sternly on Bennee.</p>

<p>“Blank,” Bennee answered with a pleased grin; satisfied
that he was learning the intricacies of the
game.</p>

<p>“Number nineteen,” Duckery called gaily; seeing
Mozella looking at him with keen anticipation.</p>

<p>“Blank,” came Bennee’s announcement.</p>

<p>“Law ...d!” reverberated Mozella’s exclamation
of disappointment. “I sho thought my number nineteen
was goin’ bring me good luck.... Da’s de
number o’ de day my sister baby was bawn....
An’ bawn wid one teeth in de front ’is mouth,
too.”</p>

<p>“O g’way from hyuh, gal,” scoffed Keziah, giving
Mozella a playful push. “Ugly an’ ill-formed as
yo’ sister baby is,—’tain no wonder yo’ li’l dime
done went astray.”</p>

<p>Much displeased at being interrupted by the laughter
that followed Keziah’s comment, Duckery
looked at the women and shouted crossly:</p>

<p>“Quit y’all wranglin’, for Gawd sake! An’ lemme
git thoo playin’ wid dis hat-full o’ papers.... You
think I wan’ stay hyuh all night?”</p>

<p>The commanding tone of his voice and the spectacular
batting of his eyelids brought immediate silence.
Whereupon he called out vehemently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Number twenny-two!”</p>

<p>“Twenny-two blank like de yuther one,” Bennee
answered with a tone of apparent surprise.</p>

<p>“You already done forgot w’at I tol’ you?” Duckery
grumbled, fixing him with a menacing stare,
before taking another slip from the hat.</p>

<p>“Number ninety-nine,” he boomed, looking at Bennee
steadily.</p>

<p>“Dis’n ain’ blank!” Bennee called out joyfully.
“Dis’n got somh’n wrote ’cross it, diffunt from all
de yuther ones.”</p>

<p>“Number ninety-nine de prize!” Broke forth the
excited chorus of soprano voices.... “Who number
ninety-nine is, Carmelite?” they questioned.
“Ninety-nine done win de quilt.... Innybody
hyuh got ninety-nine for dey number?” They babbled.
“Who ever ’tis picked ninety-nine for dey
number, sho is lucky. Ain’t dey?” The comment
went on; until Carmelite brought the list of names
and looked to see whose name was written after the
winning number.</p>

<p>“Lawd, people!” She exclaimed with delight. “Aun’
Fisky de one done win de quilt.... An’ I ain’
sorry, either. Bad as she needin’ cov’rins w’en de
col’ weather come up on ’uh.”</p>

<p>“Some people sho is lucky,” declared Lethe.</p>

<p>“Not me,” Frozine informed her. “I ain’ never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
win nothin’ in my whole life.... An’ hyuh I
comed thoo all dis mud an’ rain to witness Carmelite
fine Jacob-ladder quilt go ’way from hyuh to
lay ’cross somebody else bed.... Umph!”</p>

<p>“Who?” commented Pinkey, sympathetically.
“You ain’ need to grumble.... De onles’ thing
I ever win, was a li’l can o’ cundense milk one time....
Sho’ ’nough. No playin’,” she went on, trying to
convince them in spite of their laughter “’Twus to
a singin’ cawntes’ at de Red Bean Row, yonder in
Freetown.... An’ w’en I got home an’ went to
open de cundense milk; de thing had done turn so
sour, I was compel to th’ow it away.”</p>

<p>Becoming impatient over the long delay and the
amusing gossip of the women, Duckery asked
them:</p>

<p>“Y’all goin’ stay hyuh an’ talk all night ’bout bad
luck; an’ tell each-another ’bout all de things you
done los’?... If evvything done finish, I’m goin’
th’ow dese papers out my hat an’ go ’way from
hyuh.”</p>

<p>Carmelite took his hat and told him to wait. She had
a little surprise for everybody. She had a nice cake
she made for the occasion, and she wanted each one
to have a piece of cake and some coffee “to console
dey feelin’s for not winnin’ de quilt.” Then afterwards,
they could all go to the wake together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>The announcement brought a smile to every face.
Dink began playing on the comb with renewed
animation; and the room buzzed with merry laughter
and friendly chatter as Carmelite went back to
get the refreshments.</p>

<p>Going into the kitchen in a happy frame of mind,
she called to Gussie cheerfully:</p>

<p>“Who you reckon had de lucky number to win de
quilt, Gussie?”</p>

<p>There was no response to her question. Gussie was
sound asleep in his chair beside the stove. She decided
that it was best not to wake him until after
the refreshments were served. Then when everybody
was ready to leave, she would call him and
give him the quilt to take home to Aunt Fisky.</p>

<p>Carmelite took a knife from the safe drawer and
tiptoed over to the table to cut the cake. The plate
was empty. Nothing on it but a few scattered
crumbs to tell that just a short while before it held
a splendid duck-egg cake.</p>

<p>Could she believe her eyes? There was only one
person to suspect, she told herself. And that person
was Gussie. Nobody else had been in the kitchen
since the cake was put on the table to cool.... To
think he would do a mean, deceitful trick like that,
after she was kind enough to let him come in out of
the rain and sit by her stove to get dry.... And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
not a single piece left to offer her friends, after she
just got through telling them about her good, rich
duck-egg cake!... What would they think of
her?</p>

<p>With a sudden resolve, she hurried over to Gussie
and grabbed him by the shoulders with both
hands.</p>

<p>“Wake up hyuh! You nasty, low-down rogue....
Befo’ I pound you ’bout de head wid a billet o’
wood!” She muttered with restrained passion, shaking
him roughly. “W’at you mean, prowlin’ ’round
my kitchen an’ puttin’ yo’ filt’y han’s on things w’at
ain’ b’lonks to you?... Wake up an’ git out o’
hyuh, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Gussie opened his eyes and looked at her half dazed;
wondering who she was, and what the rough treatment
meant. His mind was not clear and he seemed
uncertain of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>“Don’t you hyeah w’at I say?” Carmelite shouted,
trying to pull him off the chair.</p>

<p>“Don’ play so rough,” Gussie pleaded, struggling
to free himself. “I ain’ goin’ bother nobody, settin’
hyuh by de stove till I git dry.”</p>

<p>“You mus’ be a drunken fool!” Carmelite answered
hotly. “After you done et up all my good cake,—thinkin’
I’m goin’ leave you stay hyuh comfatubble;
an’ I gotta go younder befo’ all dem people in de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
room, wid a empty plate?... No’n deed, Lawd!”
She vociferated, hearing the sound of footsteps approaching.
“So you better come on an’ git off dis
chair befo’ I make dem mens drag yo’ nasty body
thoo dis house an’ th’ow you in de street unmerciful!...
You hyeah?”</p>

<p>Soongy and Pinkey stood in the door looking on in
blank amazement, wondering what the difficulty
was, and asking how Gussie happened to come in
without anybody seeing him.</p>

<p>Carmelite gave a dramatic recital of Gussie’s early
arrival, his wretched condition, and her willingness
to give him shelter on account of her pity for Aunt
Fisky. She told how he promised to stay out of the
room until after the raffle was over; how she came
out to tell him that his number had won the quilt;
how she went to cut the cake and made the startling
discovery that Gussie had eaten all of it, leaving her
nothing to offer her friends except “a pot full o’
black coffee an’ plain cistun water to drink widout
nothin’ to eat.”</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do, Soongy declared
emphatically. Carmelite was too foolish, wasting
time multiplying words over ole no-count Gussie....
Nobody could do her a dirty trick like that and
sit to his ease in front of her stove.... Who?...
Talkin’ about it wouldn’t do no good.... “<i>Hands</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
was de inst’uments to start things movin’.” ... If
one woman’s pair of hands couldn’t manage ole
drunken Gussie, she bet three “wimmin’s six black
hands wouldn’ miss takin’ charge of him to land him
out-doors in de high road whah he could scuffle wid
his cawnshunce aft’ he done come thoo.”</p>

<p>Gussie looked from one to the other, uneasily; as
though he were trying to assure himself what the
commotion was about.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no need to look so pityful, an’ try an’ say
you ain’ did nothin,” Pinkey told him, going over to
his chair and seeming to adjust herself for the
coming exertion. “Yo’ time done come to vacate dis
kitchen,” she went on with assumed authority. “An’
Pinkey Clay right hyuh to tussle wid you....
Come on, Soongy,” she commanded. “You grab
hold ’is laigs to keep ’im from kickin’.... An’ you
git to de middle, Carm’lite, to keep ’im from
bendin’-in.... An’ I know w’en Pinkey Clay two
han’s git fasten ’round ’is th’oat, he sho goin’ keep
still.... An’ I <i>dare</i> ’im to w’imper!... Come
on, ole slow niggers,—git yo position!” She called
with impatience, determined to carry out her strategy
without further delay.</p>

<p>After a few seconds of strenuous tugging and lifting,
the unresisting, half-bewildered Gussie was
being hurried towards the front door in haughty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
triumph. As they passed through the front room,
the surprised members, thinking the unique spectacle
was a feature of amusement provided for their
entertainment, greeted the procession with peals of
laughter and great excitement.</p>

<p>Who could it be?... The thing looked too heavy
to be a stuffed man, because all the women were
bending.... Maybe it was a robber, Carmelite
found in her house.... What made them want to
carry the man out-doors?... Suppose somebody
dropped dead in Carmelite’s kitchen?...</p>

<p>So the riot of question and comment continued until
the three women came back, after having abruptly
deposited their obnoxious burden on the muddy
road, a short distance from the house, “to go hunt
sattafaction whah-ever he wan’ look for it.”</p>

<p>“W’at you goin’ do if Gussie come back?” Bennee
inquired, when Carmelite had finished giving a
graphic account of the mysterious proceeding;
every minor detail stressed with elocutionary fervor
for their sympathetic understanding.</p>

<p>Gussie knew better than to come back, she informed
them. ’Specially after the way all their three pair
of hands had worked on him.... Gussie wasn’t
goin’ consider comin’ back, now that the rain done
stopped, and he was out-doors where he could realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
that he wasn’t cripple complete, to hinder him
from keepin’ on goin’.</p>

<p>“But leave ole Gussie in Gawd han’s,” Carmelite
concluded with willing resignation. “An’ all y’all
members come wid me to de kitchen an’ drink some
coffee; so we kin hurry ’way from hyuh an’ go yonder
to Tempe wake.”</p>

<p>Eager to dispense with any mention of Gussie for
the time being, and wanting her friends to enjoy
what remained of the hospitality planned for them,
Carmelite hurried them to the kitchen and began
serving coffee; laughing good-naturedly as she
made amusing apologies for the “skimpy li’l refreshnin’
foods;” thanking them for “helpin’ her
out so nice”; and drinking with everyone to the
“big success” of the raffle.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter27">When Gussie recovered
from his dull bewilderment and found himself out
on the street, alone in the mud and darkness; he
tried to collect his wits and see if he could explain
what everything was about. He remembered his
long walk in the storm down to the old man Hooblitz’s
place at the edge of the woods; recalling more
vividly than anything else, the unfriendly greeting
of the old man, his cross ugly humor, and the mean
way that old Hooblitz hurried him out into the driving
rain.</p>

</div>

<p>He also had a faint remembrance of a welcome
drink with Chicken-Volsin, somewhere along the
road. But it was somewhat hazy. Not near as clear
as the recollection of himself hurrying on through
the rain to see about winning the quilt at Carmelite’s
raffle, so he could take it home to Aunt Fisky
and make the old lady feel pleased.</p>

<p>Then he remembered Carmelite’s kitchen, and the
nice warm fire in the stove; and how good he felt
when his clothes began to get dry; and the good cup
of hot coffee Carmelite gave him just before he fell
asleep. But after that, he could recall nothing more
until the time he woke up and found Carmelite
shaking him and calling him names, and talking so
loud that Pinkey and Soongy came out and pitched
into him, before he could get his right presence of
mind and keep them from over-coming him, the
same as if he was chillun.</p>

<p>Why they carried him out-doors and dumped him
in the street, he couldn’t understand to save his soul.
Carmelite must have some grudge against him, and
was mad because he came to the raffle. She didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
want him to win the quilt; and that’s the way she
fixed it up to git rid of him. But didn’t he have as
much right to be there as anybody else? Wasn’t his
dime just as good as anybody else’s money?...
But maybe it was a good thing. He had no business
going. It served him right,—running with niggers
all the time and expecting them to treat him like
their own kind.... But old man Hooblitz was
<i>white</i>. Look how <i>he</i> treated him?... What difference
did it make after all? White or colored,—nobody
gave a damn for him. All Gritny knew who
Gussie Fisky was; but that didn’t make them act
no kinder, and try to show him how to better his
poor condition....</p>

<p>Suddenly realizing that his troubled meditation was
growing into a feeling of stupid self-pity and morbid
resentment, he looked up nervously at the few
faint glimmering stars in the murky sky, wondering
where he would go to rid himself of his unhappy
mood and forget his utter loneliness.</p>

<p>Remembering Tempe’s wake, he started off down
the quiet street to the New Hope church. He went
stumbling along aimlessly over the muddy street-crossings
and puddles of water on the low uneven
banquettes, not caring whether the road was wet
or dry, or how splashed and bedraggled his clothes
became.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>When he reached the church corner he was greeted
by the blinking lights from the church windows and
the wistful singing of the members inside; and the
thought of human contact, however casual or momentary
it might be, caused him to smile and hurry
on; knowing how glad he would be to hear the sound
of some friendly voice and feel the warm touch of a
sympathetic hand.</p>

<p>As he started up the rickety steps of the church, he
stopped half way to listen to the wave of melancholy
song that came flowing out into the darkness.
It made him shiver with a strange feeling of sadness
as he caught a few words of the mournful wail and
thought of their portentous meaning....</p>

<p>“Death’s goin’-a lay his cold, icy han’ on me....”</p>

<p>He heard their full rich voices repeat the somber
message over and over. The slow, majestic movement
of the chant rising and surging over them like
a flood of melody, lifting their emotional souls to
heights of poignant ecstasy.</p>

<p>But what made them keep on telling Tempe about
what Death was going to do? Gussie asked himself;
deliberating whether he would go in or wait
until the song was finished.</p>

<p>Tempe didn’t need to know anything more about
Death.... Tempe was sitting up in the house of
death now. And she could tell a heap more about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
what was going on yonder than anybody sitting up
in the church, singing about it.... But maybe
they were trying to tell their own self something
about Death.... The way Death was going to
come up on them when their time came for crossing
over....</p>

<p>“Hell! I don’ feel like goin’ up in yonder an’ lissen
at dat kind o’ thing,” he suddenly concluded. “I’m
goin’ set hyuh on de step till dey raise some yuther
ballet mo’ sattafyin’ to de feelin’s,” he went on,
looking about for a dry spot to sit down. “Dey
oughta try an’ sing somh’n mo’ pleasin’ over Tempe.
’Stead o’ keep tellin’ ’uh w’at Death goin’ do; after
Gawd done seen fit to snatch ’uh away from hyuh
so haphazzud.”</p>

<p>After a while the melodious flowing wave began to
recede; growing fainter and fainter, until the subdued
lament faded away into a low murmuring
hum. It was soothing and pleasant, Gussie thought;
and he sat listening indolently.</p>

<p>Very soon he heard the velvety sound of a woman’s
vibrant contralto voice intone a line of another
ballet. One by one the members took up the somber
burden, proclaiming the simple words with full-voiced
exultation.</p>

<p>Getting up to go in, Gussie stopped suddenly, as the
last lines came to him....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sinner, don’t let this harves’ pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ die an’ go to Hell at las’....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singing irritated him. It made him uncomfortable
to think of the unwelcome message. Why did it
disturb him, he asked himself. Was it the slow, sad
minor tune? Or the cold, direct words of the song?</p>

<p>“Great Gawd A’mighty!” He said to himself, starting
to go down the steps. “If da’s de onles’ kind o’
singin’ dey goin’ do hyuh tonight; ’tain no pleasure
for me to linger hyuh.... Shucks! I’m goin’ yonder
’cross de Green an’ lay down an’ sleep.”</p>

<p>Trying to forget his disappointment, he began to
whistle a cheerful tune and started down the street
in the direction of the East Green. The rain was
over, but the air was damp and chilly; and long
fringes of clouds were passing across the moon in
slow-moving rifts. The houses along the road were
all closed, and everything was dark and still.</p>

<p>What would he tell Aunt Fisky about the quilt, he
asked himself. Poor old soul;—he sho counted on
bringing it home to her for a nice surprise....
Look like out of five chances, one number sho
oughta made him win the thing.... Maybe Carmelite
didn’t pick him five numbers for the four-bits
he gave her.... And Aunt Fisky needed a
good warm quilt, too.... And needed it more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
than anybody they had sittin’ up in Carmelite’s
house....</p>

<p>His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the
sound of a bell floating across the Green, not very
far away. Looking up, he saw the reflection of a
head-light on the switch engine coming towards
him.</p>

<p>“Mus’ be close on to twelve o’clock,” he remarked
casually. “Da’s ’bout de time dat switchin’ engine
come up hyuh evvy night to pull freight off Morgan
W’arf.... Lemme hurry up; an’ I kin see my
way thoo de mud, clean home, w’ile dat light shinin’
’cross de Green. ’Cause dat ole crawfish pon’ sho is
a nasty place for mud an’ slush, aft’ a hard rain like
we bin had tonight.... Ole switch engine, you sho
struck it right for Gussie dis time....” He went
on talking aloud; quickening his pace in order to get
over the track before the engine reached him.</p>

<p>Hurrying on, he looked again to see how far away
the engine was.... He could make it across the
track easy enough.... The engine wasn’t moving
very fast.... A few steps more, and he would be
over the switch before the engine reached the
corner.</p>

<p>The reflection from the head-light showed nearly
half-way across the Green. He could see the water
from the duck pond all over the road, clean up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the front gate of his house. He recognized the old
house by the thin little piece of light he saw blinking
through the leaves of the castor oil bushes growing
by the window.... Aunt Fisky must be up
yet.... She didn’t leave no candle burning when
she went to bed.... She couldn’t be sick?...
Maybe she was waiting to see if he had the quilt....
Poor ole soul,—she sho would be sorry to
know he didn’t win the thing....</p>

<p>Seeing the engine still a few feet away, he started
to run; impatient to get over the track before the
long line of box cars blocked the way and kept him
waiting in the mud and dark. He felt confident
that he would be able to clear the track with perfect
safety, just as he had done it many a night.</p>

<p>But a sinister, opposing fate decreed that Gussie’s
final hour had come. A secret snare lay in his path,
half-buried in the hard, unyielding mud.</p>

<p>There it lay hidden in the dark, sticking up like a
waiting noose to catch his hurrying foot: a treacherous
loop of rusty wire discarded from a bale of
hay, dropped on the road by a passing wagon; or
thrown there by some careless hand,—how long ago,
no one could tell.</p>

<p>A running jump, and he’d clear the track!...
But tripping on the wire, he was thrown headlong
across the rail; his unloved, unregarded body falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
an instant victim to the murderous wheels of the
heedless engine.</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter28">The morning after the raffle
at Carmelite’s house, the East Green was in a
veritable fever of excitement. Such a number of
things had happened, it seemed that all the neighbors
of the Green were out-of-doors discussing the
strange events. Some amused, others genuinely distressed;
all amazed and amazingly voluble.</p>

</div>

<p>Nobody appeared to be concerned about work.
Women on their way to market stopped at front
gates to laugh about the “upsetment” Gussie caused
at the raffle. Some stood on street corners rehearsing
the account of Tempe’s mysterious drowning
in the well, and the new pleasure that awaited them
at her approaching funeral. While others spoke in
awed tones of the disorderly conduct of Gussie at
Carmelite’s house, and the disastrous fate that followed
him on his way home.</p>

<p>Where did he go after the women carried him out
of Carmelite’s kitchen and left him on the street?
They asked one another. Nobody remembered seeing
him at Tempe’s wake.... Maybe Gussie was
drunk when the engine knocked him down?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>And what made them leave him out there on the
track alone? Didn’t nobody on the engine know they
had runned over a man?... Who found the body
first, and went and carried Aunt Fisky the bad
news?</p>

<p>So the comment and questioning continued. But no
one seemed to have any definite knowledge of the
sad tragedy. All Carmelite knew was what Aunt
Fisky had told her when she went to bring her the
quilt, early that morning. The old woman said she
got up about six o’clock; and when she opened the
gate to let the ducks out to the crawfish pond, she
saw a crowd of people standing by the switch,
across the Green. She went over to see what had
happened, and they told her that Gussie had been
run over by the switch engine sometime during the
night. That just a short while before, the man in
charge of the switch lights found the body when he
was going his rounds; and they were waiting for the
coroner to come before the body could be moved.</p>

<p>Carmelite told how she remained with Aunt Fisky,
helping her to get the house in readiness, “makin’
evvything look nice for Gussie w’en dey fetched de
body home.”</p>

<p>“Po’ ole soul, she mus’ bin bowed down heavy!”
Mozella commented feelingly.</p>

<p>“No she ain’t,” Carmelite answered. “Aun’ Fisky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
sho is got de right un’stannin’ ’bout de way Gussie
runned up on Death, an’ went ’way from hyuh wid
nobody ’round ’im.... She say Gawd was jus’
natchally watchin’ ove’ ’im careful. Right hyuh in
dis Green.... An’ knowed all ’bout de danger
comin’ up on Gussie in de darkness.... Knowed
it good.... ’Cause Gawd bin watchin’ Gussie for
a long time. An’ tol’ ’uh He was hol’in Gussie right
in ’Is han’s.... Waitin’ till de sperret command
’Im to cut Gussie down....”</p>

<p>“Dey ain’ goin’ hol’ de wake in de church, is dey?”
one of the women asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>“W’at business dey got bringin’ Gussie up in inny
church?” Carmelite asked abruptly; surprised at
her friend’s display of ignorance. “Evvybody know
old sinful Gussie ain’ never bin no Chrishtun....
Preachin’ ove’ ’im now ain’ goin’ do no good; yonder
whah he walkin’ munks all dem heavy swingein’
flames, tawmentin’ his po’ soul an’ body.”</p>

<p>“An’ I bet ole no-count Gussie ain’ left a dry nickel
to pay de un’taker for ridin’ ’im down to de graveyard,
either,” commented Soongy, shaking her
head reflectively.</p>

<p>Yes he did. Carmelite assured her. The secret society
was going to take charge of the funeral. Gussie
belonged to the “Nights o’ Peefus.” And word
had been sent to all the members to come to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
wake at Aunt Fisky’s house that night. Gussie
would be sure to have a fine funeral; she declared
with authority. Because the Peefus Lodge always
had a fine band of music. “An’ de secaterry already
done give out de news dat Gussie died finanshul.”</p>

<p>Feeling satisfied with having acquainted her friends
with all these important details, Carmelite left
them; saying that she was going to Lethe’s house to
deliver a message from Aunt Fisky.</p>

<p>Eager to bestow upon Gussie any small honor that
would lend added dignity to the farewell ceremony,
the old woman asked Carmelite to go and see some
of the friends who had played with Gussie in early
childhood, and ask them to come and serve as
pall-bearers at the funeral. Having notified all but
one, Carmelite asked Lethe to send word to Felo
and get his promise to be present the next day. This
duty accomplished, she told Lethe that she was going
home “to git down on her knees an’ wipe up all
dem mud tracks on her flo’. An’ try an’ chastise her
cawnshunce for de mean way she set to po’ Gussie.
Not knowin’ de po’ soul was jus’ ’bout ready to
stumble into Hell-fire.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ it true?” Lethe corroborated with thorough
understanding. “Dis whole life ain’ resemble nothin’
mo’n a fatal mat’en-nee.” (Matinee.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter29">Flattered with having
the honor of being the first one to acquaint Felo
with the startling account of Gussie’s death, Lethe
lost no time in hurrying to Miss Barbara’s grocery
store to communicate with him by telephone. She
knew that Felo would just be giving Mr. Amos his
breakfast; that it would be the best time to catch
him at home, before he went out to market. She was
sure that he had not heard from anyone about
Tempe’s drowning; so she would tell him all the
particulars, and all about the funeral which was to
take place that day; and maybe Felo would come
over to Gretna early, and they would have a little
visit at her house before they went to the graveyard.</p>

</div>

<p>Such astounding news from home so early in the
morning, served to arouse Felo’s excitable temperament
to unrestrained emotional flights. Mr. Amos
sat drinking his coffee, listening to Felo’s exclamations
of surprise, waiting patiently for the conversation
to end.</p>

<p>When Lethe finished her long harangue, Felo hung
up the receiver nervously and came into the dining-room,
his eyes staring with a startled expression.</p>

<p>“Dah bless Gawd!” he exclaimed; taking a seat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
across the room, near the kitchen door. “I ain’ <i>never</i>
knowed it to fail; long as I kin remember,” he went
on, with a sweeping gesture of the right arm. “Evvy
time you see me dream ’bout fresh meat, you sho
find out it ain’ goin’ be mo’n a day pass by, befo’ I
hyeah tell ’bout somebody done died.... An’ now
I bin had a dream ’bout fresh meat, dis make <i>three</i>
nights successful, han’-runnin’.... An’ hyuh
come de news from Lethe dis mawnin’, ’bout
two mo’ people done passed out, yonder in
Gritny....”</p>

<p>“Never mind your dreams,” Mr. Amos interrupted
with an amused smile. “Tell me who’s dead. And
you can think about your fresh meat afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Go ’head, an’ laugh much as you please,” Felo
answered, a trifle provoked. “Y’all w’ite folks jus’
alike.... All time ready to laugh at somh’n you
don’ un’stan....”</p>

<p>“Well, let us hear what Lethe had to say, and
maybe I will be better able to interpret your
dream,” Mr. Amos encouraged him.</p>

<p>“Da’s de very thing I wan’t tell you. If you only
keep still, an’ stop ty’in’ up my pro-gress wid so
many on-nec’sary queshtun,” he remonstrated playfully;
eager to recount Lethe’s sensational chronicle
of disaster.</p>

<p>Three deaths in less than a week’s time! He began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
solemnly.... Ole Aunt Milly from down the
bayou.... Pulled up in a skiff, all the way from
Peach Orchard.... Comin’ all that long distance,
rolled up in a blanket.... And buried in a grave
half-full of rain water! He went on enumerating
the lugubrious incidents; falling into a sort of chant,
wavering between two monotonous tones.</p>

<p>Then Tempe, fallin’ in a well and gettin’ drownded
so curuss.... And nobody able to get the straight
understandin’ about it.... And smack on top of
dat: Gussie Fisky, cut down by a switch engine
haphazzud.... Right in front of his own house, in
the black night.... And nobody close by to carry
the news.... Umph-umph! Went the vigorous
grunt of contemplation.... What was the world
comin’ to?... These Gritny people better make
haste and pray. Before Gawd reached down and
snatched at ’um; and they come to open their eyes
in Tawment.... Beggin’ for mercy when it
wasn’t no use.... “Yas Lawd!” he concluded
with a deep sigh. “It sho look like sudden deaths is
gittin’ pop’lar.”</p>

<p>Knowing Felo’s eager readiness to have a part in
every “popular” demonstration of this kind; Mr.
Amos asked him how he was going to manage to be
present at all the ceremonies.</p>

<p>No. He wasn’t going to take part in Tempe’s burying,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Felo explained. They didn’t need him to speed
Tempe over.... Tempe was a Chrishtun; and they
would have a whole multitude of wimmins there to
raise big excitement over her.... He was going
to stay home and try to “sun the house,” and wipe
up the floors.... Try and see if he couldn’t kill
that strong miljew scent Mr. Amos said he found
about the house the last couple of days.... Complainin’
and worryin’ about the dinin’room smellin’
mouldy.... And the rain bin fallin’ so steady
lately; nobody ain’ goin’ study ’bout openin’ any
window to leave in fresh air, damp as ever’thing is
out-doors.... Anybody ought to know how that
ole grass rug on the floor holds the miljew when the
weather be’s rainy.... He was going to stay
home and give all his ’tenshun to the house.... If
the sun just comed out strong and ’lowed him a
chance to work good all day....</p>

<p>But his mind told him that he had to go see Gussie
that night.... Gussie was a brother-member of
his Lodge. And it was compulsionary for him to be
at the wake and go to the funeral.... Aunt Fisky
sont him word that she wanted all Gussie’s ole-time
playmates to walk ’long-side him for pall-bearers....
So after he got through fixin’ supper, he was
goin’ to Gritny, and stay all night; and come back
in the evenin’ after the funeral was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>Fully conscious of the deep importance with which
Felo considered his sentimental expedition, and
agreeable to leaving him to the enjoyment of his
own devices; Mr. Amos told him to take the whole
day, and to let the house-cleaning go for another
time.</p>

<p>No. He insisted on following his own mind, and
getting through with what he had to do, so he would
hear no more talk about that play-gone miljew
scent in the house; when he got back from Gritny,
and wanted to tell about what took place when they
put Gussie away.... He couldn’t talk sociable
when people kept on makin’ a whole lot of complainin’....
“An’ innyway,—de sun done comed
out dis mawnin’, an’ I ain’ goin’ risk puttin’ de
thing off no longer.... So gimme some change to
go to market an’ buy yo’ li’l foods for dis evenin’....
An’ go ’head to yo’ office, an’ lemme git to my
business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos gave him the money for the purchases,
and was about to leave, when Felo followed him to
the door and asked:</p>

<p>“You want some yam sweet potato dis evenin’?
Fixed in de oven wid butter an’ milk an’ vunilla
essen’, an’ some dem w’ite-o’-aig things you call
mush-mallow?”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos gave a smile of assent, remembering this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
was one of Felo’s boasted specialties, and that it was
intended as a delicate compliment.</p>

<p>“An’ you want some smothered poke-chops, an’
stuffed aigplant wid swimps in ’um?” Felo suggested.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to make such a feast?” Mr.
Amos asked in surprise. “After you finish all the
house-cleaning you say you mean to do, you better
rest yourself; if you hope to do any singing at a
wake tonight.... Fix the yams, if you care to.
But get something else easy to cook.”</p>

<p>“Man, go ’head to yo’ office, for Gawd sake,” Felo
told him; provoked at having his show of hospitality
received with such marked indifference. “’Tain
no use try’n to sattafy some people, w’en dey ain’
never learnt how to ’preshate li’l favors did for ’um
wid a free heart.... Go ’head to yo’ office....
An’ you better be glad if you come back hyuh an’
fin’ coffee an’ bread to eat, w’en you git home dis
evenin’.”</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter30">Left to himself, after he
had done his marketing in the neighborhood, it was
not long until Felo’s domestic maneuvering was in
full swing. Any casual passer-by would have supposed
the house was in process of evacuation. Festoons
of bed-clothes and barricades of pillows protruded
negligently from upstairs windows; scarves
and cushions and draperies of many colors flaunted
in reckless abandon from down-stairs windows;
rugs hung over the side fence, and blankets flapped
on the back-yard clothes-line. Everything was
brought out to bask in the welcome sunshine and to
gather freshness from the pleasant flowing breeze.
Filled with abundant energy and the unflagging
desire to please, Felo was determined to overlook
no single detail about the house. Work don’t never
hurt nobody if they goes at it with the right sperret,
he told himself.... He sho was goin’ to try his
best to keep people from thinkin’ his boss was runnin’
a li’l ole picayune boa’din’-house.... This
house was a rezzident; and he sho was goin’ keep it
lookin’ so.... And Mr. Amos never need feel
’shamed to have any comp’ny try to ’zamine his toys
and things, and all them “heavy-heavy-hangs-ove’-yo’-head”
he had on the wall; after Felo got done
playin’ with ’um....</p>

</div>

<p>When he came home in the evening, Mr. Amos was
struck by the orderly appearance of everything.
The rugs were fresh-looking and arranged with
care; the floors and the furniture were rubbed and
polished; bright flowers were on the piano and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
tables; and the whole house looked cheerful and inviting.</p>

<p>As he walked back to the diningroom he heard the
pleasant sound of Felo’s voice, singing at his work
in the kitchen.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Death he is a cruel monster in dis lan’;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You kin call but he won’t answer, ain’t it gran’?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words didn’t carry a very cheerful greeting;
but the melody was a lovely one; thought Mr.
Amos, as he stood listening, waiting until Felo
would finish the verse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I kin leave at break of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You will find but empty clay,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lawd, I wonder w’at they’ll say</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">W’en I’m gone...?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What a strange allurement death and wakes and
funerals seem to hold out to him; when at heart he
is really of a happy disposition,” Mr. Amos commented,
as Felo ended his song and changed to a
soft murmuring hum.</p>

<p>Mr. Amos stood looking about the room, waiting
for Felo to sing again. Suddenly he became conscious
of the odor of pineapple. Wondering where
it came from, he soon discovered a large pineapple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
towering out of the punch bowl on the corner cupboard,
and another one standing on a tray on the
side table.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you call this?” He asked Felo, not
knowing how to regard the unusual decoration.</p>

<p>Felo came in from the kitchen, smiling, wanting to
know if everything wasn’t “sattafactual.”</p>

<p>Everything was fine. He was thoroughly pleased;
Mr. Amos told him. “But will you kindly tell me
why you bought these pineapples and put them in
here after this fashion?”</p>

<p>Felo looked at the pineapples thoughtfully, his face
assuming a puzzled expression. What was the matter
with them? They were nice and fresh.... He
never let nobody sell him no cheap rotten fruits....
These pineapples were fine ripe pineapples....
And nobody couldn’t buy no better pineapples
for two-bits a piece....</p>

<p>“But you know I never eat pineapples,” Mr. Amos
informed him placidly.</p>

<p>“Dah bless Gawd!” Felo exclaimed, abashed; rolling
his eyes impressively from one pineapple to the
other. “You know, I clean forgot you ain’ never
eat pineapple,” he tried to explain. “Gawd knows.”
He apologized with deep feeling. “De thing sho did
slip my membunce, jus’ like I tell you.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the reason why you bought two pineapples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
instead of one?” Mr. Amos asked, teasingly.</p>

<p>“You ain’ try’n to raise no complaint ’bout fo’-bits,
is you?” Felo went on. “But you know, de things
look so nice an’ temptin’ w’en I seen ’um on de
Dago stan’ dis mawnin’; I thought on w’at I
hyeah’d you say,—how dis place smell so mouldy....
So I say: I’m goin’ buy dese pair o’ pineapples
an’ put ’um in de room hyuh; an’ I know dey
goin’ sho out-stink a billy-goat.... An’ I bet you
ain’ smell no miljew scent up in hyuh now. Is
you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos complimented him on his novel method
of disinfecting, but said he preferred to smell the
tempting scent that came floating in from the
pots.</p>

<p>Felo rolled his eyes appreciatively, saying:</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up an’ set to de table, an’ lemme bring
you yo’ li’l foods befo’ yo’ appatite fo’sake you.
Evvything ready. So come on an’ eat. An’ maybe I
kin go ’way from hyuh soon, w’en I git thoo waitin’
on you.”</p>

<p>Further urging was unnecessary. Mr. Amos knew
by the regaling odors coming from the kitchen,
that the evening meal would consist of much more
than the meager “coffee and bread” which Felo
promised in the morning. Having revoked his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
threat, in spite of the many duties accomplished that
day, Felo had exerted himself in preparing a truly
noble dinner.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with the simple luxury of eggplant
stuffed with shrimp and tomato, seasoned with
onion, thyme, parsley and red pepper, macerated
with milk and butter, Felo had added the epicurean
garnish of rolled toast and grated sapsago cheese.
The yam potatoes, crowned with an aureole of
golden-brown marshmallows, looked like an arrangement
of autumn leaves mottled with sunshine;
and Mr. Amos found himself wondering if it were
not a bowl of delectable vegetables masquerading as
a delicious dessert. The pork chops were smothered
in a rich tomato gravy flavored with cloves and
lemon peel; a tempting ragout, which Felo assured
Mr. Amos, as he placed before him a plate of hot
biscuits just out of the oven, “sho will make you
rear back an’ smack yo’ lips manful, after you done
sopped some o’ dese light biscuits in dis good ole-time
Creyall gravy.”</p>

<p>Knowing that Felo at all times looked for more
active proof than simple words of praise in appreciation
of his culinary efforts, Mr. Amos endeavored
to “perish” and “destroy” as much as was
humanly possible. Because Felo was most pleased
when he saw people “eat good”; and “et like dey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
bin use to good eatin’.” Feeling that “a dinner table
full o’ empty plates an’ dishes was cert’ny mo’ convincin’
den a whole lot o’ col’ overs settin’ up in de
’frigerator.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Amos finished his coffee, he went upstairs
to lie down, leaving Felo to “scuffle wid his
pots an’ make quick tracks for Gritny.” It was not
long before the kitchen boomed with the happy
chorus of “De ole sheep done knowed de road”;
every now and then a broken cadence floating off
through the house like the sound of jubilation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My brother, ain’t you got yo’ counts all sealed?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">De young lambs mus’ find de way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You better git ’um ready ’fore you leave dis field;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">De young lambs mus’ find de way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a pleasant sound, and Mr. Amos delayed
reading his book as long as the singing continued.
As soon as there was silence in the kitchen, he knew
that Felo was dressing, and that it would not be
long until he was on his way across the river to
Gussie’s wake.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter31">If there were two particular
forms of divertissement equally cherished by every
dweller of the East Green and thereabouts, perhaps
the one holding second place would be the fine funeral
following a nice wake. Granting this, it was
easy to understand why Gussie’s obsequies seemed
to offer something of more than ordinary importance.
Being a white man, and an outcast among his
own color; and a man without religion, and therefore
counted a lost soul among his church-going
colored companions; they were deeply concerned
about how he would be “put away with any right
kind of form and fashion.” ... Who could they
get to preach his funeral if the colored elder didn’t
want to come?... Maybe Aunt Fisky would get
the white folks to bring the priest to say prayers
and swing smoke over Gussie and sprinkle him with
holy water?...</p>

</div>

<p>Conjectural comment was at its height when Felo
arrived. And curious to know the full particulars,
like all the other members present, he asked Aunt
Fisky if she had done anything regarding the funeral
ceremonies. She told him quietly that she didn’t
want any priest or revyun of any kind to come up
in her house.... She wasn’t no hypocrite....
Everybody in Gritny knew that Gussie never was
no church member.... And now that Gussie was
’ceased, there wasn’t no use for any elder to stand
up and preach about his sinful ways.... It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
couldn’t help Gussie none. And what good would it
do anybody else?... They ain’t got to tell Gawd
about it; ’cause Gawd already knowed what Gussie
was. So He didn’t have to listen to a whole lot o’
random.... And besides, she didn’t believe in
rakin’-up people’s wrong-doin’ after they gone.
The members could sing over Gussie much as they
pleased. And the man from the Peefus Lodge could
say the Ow Father and read something out his book.
And that’s all she cared about.... And she was
goin’ to see that they did it, too.... Gussie had
dragged on long enough with a whole lot o’ racket
and confusion. So she made up her mind that she
was goin’ to see him go ’way from this earth quiet
and respectable.... She wasn’t goin’ to find no
fault ’bout havin’ a brass band; ’cause she knowed
Gussie always liked music and was <i>too</i> proud to
walk behind a purrade. So, if people cared anything
at all about her and Gussie feelin’s, she cert’ny
would look to see them respect her wishes in this
lonesome interprise....</p>

<p>Felo said he would tell everyone present, and promised
to see that her wishes would be obeyed. He went
over to talk to Carmelite, where she was sitting in
a corner, looking very dejected. She shook hands
with him and listened silently as he repeated what
Aunt Fisky had told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“An’ you sho kin count on me, Mr. Felo, to help
you make dese niggers do de right thing,” Carmelite
assured him feelingly.</p>

<p>“You goin’ set up all night?” Felo asked her.</p>

<p>“Sho Gawd is,” she declared with fervor. “Bad as I
feel; I’m goin’ stay right hyuh, an’ fix de coffee an’
do all I kin, befo’ I go home to my house.”</p>

<p>“W’a’s de matter?” Felo asked wonderingly. “You
ain’ sick, is you?”</p>

<p>No; she wasn’t ’zacly sick; Carmelite told him. She
was jus’ feelin’ down-casted.... Sittin’ there an’
lookin’ at Gussie, an’ callin’ back to her mind what
took place to her house last night.... Gussie
eatin’ up all her duck-egg cake with nobody but
himself, yonder in her kitchen.... And hyuh a
whole crowd o’ people come to eat crackers and
coffee over Gussie; and he layin there on the table
and ain’t knowin’ a thing ’bout what was goin’
on....</p>

<p>“An’ lookin’ so natchal, too. Widout any puttin’-on
a-tall,” came Frozine’s sympathetic comment.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it true,” agreed Mozella. “For a man bin cut
half-in-two like he is, Gussie sho do look natchal.”</p>

<p>“An’ ain’ he got a nice pale color?” remarked
Soongy.</p>

<p>“Sho is,” declared Nookie. “I ain’ never took notice
till now, how pale Gussie complexion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>“Look like Death done bleached his skin mo’
lighter,” Carmelite reflected pensively.</p>

<p>“An’ Gussie sho look like somebody diffunt, layin’
up there strouded in dem purrade clo’se he got on,”
said Pinkey, taking a seat along-side of Carmelite.</p>

<p>At sight of Aunt Fisky coming in from the back
room, all comment ceased for a while. She came over
where the women were sitting, and gave Carmelite
a pan full of orange leaves, asking her to pin them
on the sheet “droped” over the table where Gussie
was lying. Carmelite and several of the women got
down on their knees and began pinning the orange
leaves on the sheet, making a border in the form of a
cross all around the bier.</p>

<p>At length, a low mournful humming began to
tremble in the room as the women went on with
their work in the dim weird light from the flickering
candles, standing in bottles on the mantelpiece and
on the table at Gussie’s head and feet.</p>

<p>Before long the old house was vibrating to the rolling
sound of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Didn’t my Lawd deliver Daniel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And why not every man...?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Their voices pulsating with unusual fervor and their
minds thrilled with the import of the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent2">’ll be glad to pray dat day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One by one the neighbors continued to come in, each
one bringing along from home a chair to sit on;
knowing that Aunt Fisky would not be able to accommodate
them, and that the crowd would increase
as the night went on.</p>

<p>Felo began looking about eagerly to see if Lethe
had come. What kept her so late? He asked himself....
He would run around to her house to see
what was the matter.... Now was a good time.
The singing was at its height.... Nobody would
miss him....</p>

</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter32">Felo lost no time, but
hurried on across the Green and down the street to
Lethe’s house. As he opened the gate, he was surprised
to find her sitting on the gallery steps, leaning
against the post in the darkness.</p>

</div>

<p>“W’at you doin’, settin’ out hyuh in de jew all
alone?” He asked abruptly. “Who you waitin’ for?
Settin’ out hyuh in de dark, wid dis chill air blowin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>

<p>“I’m waitin’ hyuh for Lizzie Cole to come,” Lethe
answered, quietly.</p>

<p>“Settin’ out hyuh on-cuncerned, waitin’ for ole
loud-mouth Lizzie; an’ Aun’ Fisky an’ evvybody
waitin’ yonder for you to come to Gussie wake; an’

complained. “W’at kind o’ game dis is you play’n,
inny-way?” He demanded with mock seriousness.
“You ain’ inten’ to go to de wake tonight?”</p>

<p>“I gotta wait hyuh till Lizzie come wid dem chickens,
befo’ I kin go,” Lethe answered calmly.</p>

<p>“W’at chickens you talkin’ ’bout?” He asked impatiently.
“I don’ know nothin’ ’bout any chickens.... Ole
crazy Lizzie ain’ thinkin’ ’bout bringin’
no chickens to Gussie wake, is she?... An’ you
ain’ wan’ play fool an’ uphol’ ’uh in ’uh devilment?”</p>

<p>“Felo, for Gawd sake set down, an’ don’ talk so

for ’uh till she come back from sugar-grindin’, yonder
whah she goin’ to Lafoosh plantation.”</p>

<p>“W’en she goin’?” Felo asked, sitting down beside
Lethe on the step.</p>

<p>“Dey got a whole crowd o’ wimmins goin’ in de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>

<p>“Chester gone away,” Lethe informed him.</p>

<p>“Who? Chester gone sugar-grindin’!” Felo exclaimed,
laughing with great amusement. “Lizzie
Cole better hurry an’ go yonder an’ look after
Chester, befo’ some dem green country niggers

<p>“W’at make you all time wan’ be so scoffish?” Lethe
asked him. “Chester ain’ big enough to take care
himself?... Chester ain’ simple.... An’ you
ain’ need to worry ’bout Chester. ’Cause Chester
ain’ gone to no country to cut no sugar cane....
Whah Chester gone ain’ nobody business. So try’n
keep still, an’ don’ be talkin’ all ove’ yo’ mouth
till you know somh’n ’bout people mo’ better’n
guessin’ an’ supposin’.”</p>

<p>“But no!” Felo faltered; surprised at her unexpected
defensive attitude. “Since w’en you done
come to be mixed up in Chester business so, you
gotta set to me like dis?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“Felo, is you a plumb fool all by yo’-self?” Lethe
asked him quietly. “W’at I wan’ do, havin’ any
traffic wid chillun like Chester?... You ain’ got
to come hyuh an’ ’cuse me, suspicious like dat....”</p>

<p>“Chillun, man, or boy; or w’atsome-ever you wan’
call it,” he interrupted sullenly. “But look like
y’all two mus’ be got some kind o’ secut un’stannin’
wid each-another; w’en you so quick to take up de
queshtun, an’ ack like you know somh’n you don’
wan’ tell ’bout.... But da’s alright,” he went on,
with an aggrieved air. “You ain’ compel to lemme
know w’at goin’ on.... W’en you got Chester
right hyuh so conveenyun all de time; an’ I’m way
yonder ’cross de river, countin’ on evvything bein’
straight, an’ trus’in all things is fair an’ square....
You ain’ compel to tell me nothin’, if da’s de
way yo’ mind lead you....”</p>

<p>“Felo, for Gawd sake, shet yo’ mouth an’ keep
still,” Lethe told him; getting up from the steps and
starting to go into the house. “Hyuh come Lizzie,
now.... So come in-doors, if you wan’ find out
’bout Chester.... Leave Lizzie tell you ’bout
him. She ain’ goin’ hol’ nothin’ back from you....
Hyuh she is, now. Go ’head inside; an’ don’ look so
hateful.”</p>

<p>Lizzie arrived with a great bunch of squawking
chickens in each hand. Seeing the gate closed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
unable to help herself, she called out boisterously:</p>

<p>“Whah y’all done lef’ yo’ manners, you can’t come
hyuh an’ open dis gate an’ lemme in? You wan’
leave me stay out hyuh all night helpless? Wid all
dis mighty roocus dese crazy chickens raisin’ right
hyuh in front Lethe door?... Come open dis
gate, for Gawd sake. Befo’ some dese inquiztun
w’ite folks run up hyuh an’ try to ’res’ Lizzie for
robbin’ people hen-roos’ after hours like dis is....
Stop yo’ grinnin’, an’ come hyuh an’ gimme a
han’,” she commanded.</p>

<p>Felo hurried to open the gate and let her in, and
Lethe led the way to the back yard; both of them
laughing heartily at Lizzie’s amusing speech and the
antics she performed as she deposited the squawking
chickens on the ground. Felo helped her untie the
strings from their feet, and after they were put
away for the night and Lethe saw that the chicken
house door was made fast, the party went into the
kitchen and sat down to talk.</p>

<p>After scanning the room inquisitively, Lizzie got up
and helped herself to a dipper of water from the
bucket standing on the table; then kicked off her
shoes and made herself ready to enjoy any form of
entertainment the night would offer. Seeing that
she was in a loquacious humor, Lethe encouraged
her to talk of Chester; knowing how curious Felo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
was to learn something of his whereabouts. At the
mention of his name, Felo asked if Chester was going
to the wake.</p>

<p>“No,” Lizzie answered quietly; then added with a
grandiloquent air, that Mr. Frackshun was
trav’lin’.</p>

<p>“To Lafourche?” Felo inquired.</p>

<p>“No. To furren parts,” Lizzie told him, enigmatically.</p>

<p>“To the sugar-grindin’?” Felo persisted.</p>

<p>No. Mr. Frackshun didn’t care nothin’ ’bout playin’
in a cane field; Lizzie informed him facetiously. Mr.
Frackshun said he found cuttin’ cane too bitterly
against the constitution.... ’Tain’ everybody kin
stand it like wimmins bin use to it.... An’ innyway,
Mr. Frackshun said he was afraid of his feets
gittin’ fros’-bitten, cold mawnin’s like they had in
the country.... And a cane-knife was such a
dang’us-lookin’ weepon, Mr. Frackshun said he
couldn’t see how he was goin’ to git use to totin’
one....</p>

<p>What was Lizzie tryin’ to make out of Chester?
Felo asked her reprovingly. Since when did
Chester come to be so high-up and particular that
he could pick and choose the kind of work he wanted
to do, when niggers in Gritny was glad to do any
kind of work that come to their hand, tight as money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
was this time of the year?... Was she satisfied
to listen to Chester’s crazy talk, and leave him stay
home playin’ weak and timmasun, layin’ up on her
all winter long doin’ nothin’? While she was scufflin’
yonder in the frosty cane-field, workin’ her poor
fool-self to death till way after Christmas, when the
grindin’ was over?... Lizzie must think Chester
was some kind of jew’lry had to be locked up in the
house to keep people from runnin’ off with....</p>

<p>“But you know de ole house so rickety an’ lavadated,
Mr. Felo, da’s de very reason I sont Chester
’way from hyuh,” Lizzie told him with impressive
seriousness. “My li’l ole shanty ain’ no safe place
to hide nothin’ w’en dese Gritny w’ite folks commences
plund’in an’ searchin’.... An’ jus’ like
you say,—Chester so simple an’ timmasun,—Lizzie
ain’ feel like she wan’ take no chances.... So da’s
how come she make de jew’lry take a depahter.”
(Departure.)</p>

<p>“Lawd! Lizzie, you sho is a circus,” exclaimed
Lethe, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>Felo looked puzzled and annoyed, and scowled at
Lethe, wondering at her amusement. What did Lizzie
mean? He asked her impatiently. Did she think
he came there to waste time and listen to a whole lot
of riddles and humbug?... He wasn’t no chillun....
If she wanted to talk, why didn’t she talk plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and natchal; and not try to talk a mouth full of
mystery nobody wasn’t able to ’lucidate....</p>

<p>“Dey ain’ got no myst’ry ’bout Chester goin’ ’way
from hyuh, Mr. Felo,” Lizzie explained quietly. “I
<i>sont</i> de boy ’way from hyuh; an’ I know de place
whah he gone to. An’ dey ain’ nobody else but Lizzie
Cole to be helt ’sponsible for de boy welfare,
w’en de time come for givin’ ’count on Chester
Frackshun disa’pyunce out o’ Gritny.... So sen’
’um to me, w’en dey wan’ ax queshtun an’ find out
somh’n.... I ain’t ’fraid to face ’um.”</p>

<p>“Who dat you got to face ’bout Chester goin’
away?” Felo asked quickly.</p>

<p>“All dem parties an’ parties settin’ up in de cou’t-house,
try’n to play smart,” Lizzie answered.</p>

<p>“W’at thing dis Chester done commit, you gotta
worry ’bout people in de cou’t-house callin’ on you?”
Felo asked with eager surprise.</p>

<p>“’Tain’ nothin’ Chester did,—’zac’ly speakin’,” Lizzie
went on to explain. It was the things the white
folks might come to do if they heard that Chester
was under suspicion.... Because he had already
runned up on danger two times: with all these niggers
blabbin’ about the way ole Unc’ Peesah died.
And about the needle Tempe got from Chester the
night before the old man passed out. Then come
Unc’ Nat, spreadin’ the news that Chester was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
one that left the well open at the corner the night
Tempe got drownded, makin’ it look like the boy
wanted to get her out of the way to stop any more
talk about the fatal needle.... Who? No indeed....
She wasn’t goin’ to leave a poor simple
motherless boy like Chester stay home alone when
she went to the sugar-grindin’, so the white folks
could come and land him up in jail; when he was
just natchally innocent and helpless.... ’Specially
when that man lookin’ after the light on the
Morgan road, had come to her the mawnin’ after
Gussie was runned over; inquirin’ what time it was
when Chester come home the night before; and if he
seen the switch light burnin’ when he went ’cross the
Green.... Tryin’ to make it look like Chester had
somh’n to do with bein’ mixed-up in how Gussie
come to be runned over by a switch engine....</p>

<p>“Lawd, Lizzie! Go ’way from hyuh,” Lethe exclaimed
aghast. “You ain’ never tol’ me dat befo’.”</p>

<p>“W’at you said to de man?” Felo asked, greatly
concerned.</p>

<p>“I say: Who you mean, Chester Frackshun?... I
say: Dis de place he live; but he ain’ bin home hyuh
for over a week.... I say: Chester yonder ’cross
de lake, workin’ in a saw mill on Blind River. An’
I know he ain’ seen no kind o’ switch light yonder in
dat swampy lonesome country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“An’ Chester was already gone away?” Felo wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Who?” Lizzie laughed, pleased with the remembrance
of her little stratagem. Chester was right
there in the kitchen, down on his knees, she went on
to relate; close enough for the man to hear the
sound of the scrubbin’-brush swishin’ up an’ down
the kitchen flo’, right behind where she was standin’
in the door-way.</p>

<p>“But soon as de man shet de gate an’ went away,
I say: Chester, put dat scrubbin’-brush an’ bucket
out yo’ han’s, an’ git up from hyuh an’ pack yo’
clo’se quick as you kin git ’um together.... You
gotta go ’way from hyuh tonight,—an’ not a <i>word</i>
from you.... Hyuh come another death done
layed at you do’. So you ain’ got a thing to do, but
hurry ’way from dis place, an’ stay ’way from hyuh
till all dis commotion pass over an’ times come to be
natchal again.... ’Cause you know, I’m goin’
yonder to Lafoosh to de grindin’; an’ you ain’ got
strank enough to fight all dese Gritny w’ite folks
w’en dey commence pickin’ on you, an’ Lizzie ain’
hyuh to puhteck you.... So git together all yo’
few l’il scat’rin rags; ’cause I wan’ see you leave dis
house tonight, soon’s it git dark....”</p>

<p>“An’ you made ’im go ’way?” Felo interrupted.</p>

<p>“Who? Chester ain’ no fool,” she answered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
“Chester know too good, how he gotta listen w’en
Lizzie lay down de law an’ preach ’im somh’n cuncernin’
of ’is welfare.... Yas indeed, he went
away,” she continued. “Went away wid ’is li’l
bundle und’ ’is arm, quick as I could git yonder to
de boat landin’ on de Basin, an’ make ’rangements
wid de man on de charcoal lugger to take Chester
’long wid ’im to do de cookin’ on de trip over.”</p>

<p>“So da’s w’at Chester goin’ do now? Go back to
cookin’ on de charcoal luggers for de winter?” Felo
inquired.</p>

<p>“I ain’ told you Chester was goin’ stay on no charcoal
lugger all winter,” Lizzie informed him
sharply.</p>

<p>“Den whah Chester gone?” Felo demanded.</p>

<p>“To furren parts,” Lizzie replied with tantalizing
artfulness.</p>

<p>Felo looked at her with a scowl of displeasure, feeling
that she meant to withhold something important
from him. What made her act so tight-mouth, and
try to keep things so secret? He asked with impatience.
Did she have to hide things like that from
close friends like him and Lethe?... Didn’t she
know that both of them would be ready to stand by
Chester if he got into any trouble with the white
folks?... What ailed her, anyway?</p>

<p>Mr. Felo had to excuse her, Lizzie informed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
politely; but she just natchally couldn’t trust no
’ceitful niggers, any more than she could trust some
of the white folks.... ’Specially white folks like
some of them shoo-fly offsprings they had sittin’ up
in the court house....</p>

<p>“But who is you, in de name o’ Gawd?” Lethe asked
in a surprised voice, looking at her quietly and
speaking very slowly. “Settin’ hyuh talkin’ ’bout
niggers bein’ ’ceitful,—wid all dis mighty ’thawity
to criticize yo’ own color?... <i>You</i> ain’ ’ceitful, is
you?... Scandalizin’ w’ite folks you done growed
up wid; w’en you oughta be proud to give ’um
respec’ for all de ’sistance you got from ’um in de
needed time.... Gawd knows, Lizzie, you sho
oughta be shame to make little o’ yo’ Gritny people
like dat.”</p>

<p>“Leave Lizzie ’lone, an’ quit talkin’, Lethe; an’ le’s
go yonder to Gussie wake whah things is peaceful,”
Felo suggested with sudden abruptness. “Lizzie ain’
bin use to nothin’, no-how; an’ da’s w’at make her so
scawnful ’bout de w’ite folks. She jus’ like de res’ o’
dese po’ ignun niggers, ain’ got no inher’tunce.”</p>

<p>What kind of inheritance did some of the white
folks sittin’ up in the court house have? Lizzie
wanted to know. Did Mr. Felo ever take notice how
many of the people holdin’ high office in the court
house, ain’t been connected with nothin’ but cows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
one generation to another?... Who?... She
could look back long as she knowed, and could tell
about the time when their gramma and grampa
went grassin’ ’long-side the railroad track with a
wheel-barrow.... And the many times she seen
their parents pushin’ cows to the pasture back and
forth.... And right now, she could call the name
of <i>plenty</i> of them drawin’ pay from the court house,
what was makin’ extra change, sellin’ cream cheese
and buttermilk from the cows they had in their
yard.... And was that kind o’ practice-habit the
thing Mr. Felo wanted to call inheritance?...
Who? She asked him, laughing with great amusement....
A grass sickle, cows, and some cream
cheese moulds wasn’t nothin’ she could see to make
people set up and put on airs like folks what comed
from a family of ’ridginy people....</p>

<p>“But w’at all dis hist’ry got to do wid Chester goin’
away from Gritny?” Felo asked with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>It had plenty to do with it; Lizzie assured him. She
was sharp enough to know what would happen if
people kept on talkin’ about Chester and Tempe
and the needle and the fatal switch engine; tryin’ to
make him answer for somethin’ when he wasn’t
guilty.... No indeed. She wasn’t goin’ to take
no fool chances with court-house people she knowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
so good.... White folks what always bin used to
somh’n, never was hard on niggers; even way back
in Reb’-time days. And anybody ever bin had any
traffic with them could tell you the same thing....
And Mr. Felo could ask his Ma Fanny, and
find out for himself she wasn’t tellin’ no lie. ’Cause
all the people along the coast knowed the hist’ry
about the Derbignys and the Garderes and the De
Gruy family, and some them yuther plantation people
what always had somh’n; and how they was
good to their cullud folks.... Even today....</p>

<p>“But who wan’ put inny pennunce in shoo-fly people
an’ off-springs?” She asked indignantly. “No
indeed, Lawd! Not Lizzie Cole.... No matter if
her father is a preacher o’ de gospel, an’ tries to
make her b’lieve she gotta love her neighbor like she
love herself.... Who? Mr. Felo think she goin’
study ’bout givin’ people love an’ trus’, w’en she
look back an’ ain’ see nothin’ behin’ ’um but a ginneration
o’ cattle an’ cows?” ...</p>

<p>“An’ you ain’ goin’ leave none yo’ own color know
whah Chester gone to?” Felo asked.</p>

<p>No. Lizzie answered positively. She had passed her
hand ’cross her mouth, and wasn’t goin’ to say
nothin’ to <i>nobody</i> till she came back from the
grindin’ after Christmas, with a pocket full of
money.... Then she would bring Chester back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
to the castle yonder ’cross the pasture, and spread
joy for all the hongry niggers in the East Green....
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But now that she had the boy out of danger,</span><br>
she was goin’ to Lafoosh to have a good time, with
Scilla and Nookie and Carmelite and Pinkey, and
all the other wimmins that said they were goin’....
Soongy said she was countin’ on goin’, if she
could fix it so Dink could stay at Aunt Fisky’s
house till she come back.... Now that Gussie
was gone, Dink would be a good help to Aunt
Fisky; runnin’ to the groc’ry and washin’ dishes
and ’tendin’ to her ducks and things. ’Cause Soongy
cert’ny had raised Dink handy and nice.</p>

<p>“But none y’all ain’ goin’ to Gussie funeyul tomorrow?”
Lethe asked her dubiously.</p>

<p>“Who?” Lizzie exclaimed, greatly surprised at the
question. “You ain’ think Lizzie goin’ run to de
country careless, an’ leave a fine brass ban’ behind
her, like dey say dey goin’ have tootin’ music in
front o’ Gussie, is you?... No indeed.... Lizzie
too crazy ’bout music to go ’way from hyuh till
after dey done put Gussie away an’ all de purrade
over. Den she kin git on de train wid happy membunce
o’ Gussie, an’ go to de grindin’ well pleased.”</p>

<p>If the band of music was the only thing leadin’ Lizzie
to stay over to go to the funeral, she ought to be
more decent and not tell it; Felo reprimanded, batting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
his eyelids crossly. If she didn’t want to give
any respect to Gussie, she ought to stay at home,
and not play hypocrite so brazen before a whole
crowd of people, right in front of Aunt Fisky’s
face.</p>

<p>She never did care nothin’ for ole no-nation Gussie;
Lizzie told him frankly. And she didn’t have respect
to study about. But a brass band was a diffunt
queshtun.... <i>Goin’</i> to the funeral wasn’t the
main part she had to consider. It was comin’ back,
dancin’ to the music, all the way from the graveyard
to the Gritny ferry-boat.... Who?... That was
enough to make her don’t care if she missed forty
Morgan trains goin’ to the grindin’.... Everybody
knowed how all them Gritny niggers would
come skippin’ and prancin’ up Main Street, when
they heard that brass band commence soundin’ them
teasin’ blues.... And if they just started playin’
“O Didn’t He Ramble,”—she cert’ny knowed there
wasn’t <i>nothin’</i> goin’ to keep her from shakin’ her
fool-self to a fraz’lin finish....</p>

<p>“Lethe!” Felo exclaimed, exasperated; rolling his
eyes ominously. “You sit hyuh quiet, an’ listen at dis
Hell-bound ooman talk like dat, an’ ain’ say nothin’
to ’uh?... Git up from hyuh an’ come on, if you
goin’ wid me to Gussie wake tonight. An’ leave Lizzie
hyuh to do like de devil lead ’uh to do....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
’Cause I done los’ all patience wid ’uh. An’ I know
Gawd ain’ goin’ bother wid ’uh.... So come
on!”</p>

<p>“You goin’ to de wake?” Lethe asked her, getting
up and reaching for her shawl, hanging on a nail
behind the door.</p>

<p>“No,” Lizzie answered, smiling placidly. “You go
’head an’ take yo’ pleasure wid Mr. Felo, yonder
munks de Chrishtuns. I’m goin’ stay hyuh for a li’l
w’ile an’ make me some weak coffee, if you don’
mind.... But I’ll sho meet you tomorrow,
dancin’ in de road, comin’ back; befo’ I take de
train in de evenin’ for Lafoosh plantation.”</p>

<p>Lethe told her to make herself at home, and started
for the front door with Felo following her, his eyes
fixed on Lizzie with a glowering look.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Felo,” she called to him in a
derisive tone. “An’ I hope Gawd take care o’ yo’
th’oat w’en you singin’ over Gussie so bol’ an’ manful,
yonder munks de Chrishtuns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="nobreak dropcap" id="chapter33">On reaching home in the
evening, Mr. Amos was somewhat surprised to find
all the windows and doors open and lights burning
in all the rooms, seeming to anticipate the arrival of
some friendly guest. The table was set for one person,
and the pots on the kitchen stove gave evidence
that everything was ready for the evening meal; but
Felo was not in sight. Going to the kitchen door,
Mr. Amos found him in the back yard, quietly hoeing
his little hill of snap-beans, growing along the
side fence; so intent upon his gardening that he was
not aware of being watched until Mr. Amos spoke;
inquiring what all the illuminations meant, and if he
were expecting anybody.</p>

</div>

<p>“Nobody but you,” Felo told him placidly. “Lessen
somebody comin’ hyuh unbeknownce.”</p>

<p>“Then, why all the lights?” Mr. Amos faltered.</p>

<p>“Man, go inside an’ set to de table; an’ don’ be so
hard to please,” Felo went on. “W’at dey is wrong,
you can’ come home now an’ den, an’ fin’ de house
lookin’ like things givin’ you welcome, aft’ a hard
day struggle?... If dis yo’ resident, an’ de place
whah you look to find yo’ peace an’ comfut; I ain’
see how you gotta think ’bout makin’ a whole lot o’
extra show for out-side people, an’ don’ wan’ make
none for yo’-own self.... ’Specially w’en you
cunsider you ain’ got so long to enjoy yo’ life; an’
dey ain’ nobody to ’preshate de place no better’n
you an’ me.... Go set down, for Gawd sake. An’
don’ try to make me feel any wusser’n I feel already....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Disappointed like I bin today wid people
I sho thought I could count on....”</p>

<p>What could have happened to bring on a mood like
this? Mr. Amos wondered. Did anything go wrong
at the wake or the funeral? “I thought you would
come home bubbling over with news, and couldn’t
wait to tell what you saw,” he said to Felo, as he
came in from the yard and began making ready to
serve dinner.</p>

<p>He didn’t feel like talkin’, Felo answered. He had
to look after them snap-beans, and twist them
around the cane-reed poles he brought from home;
before the wind broke all the runners and fixed them
so they wouldn’t make no beans; after all the bother
he had with them, waterin’ and ’tendin’ them like
he did every evenin’....</p>

<p>“So set down an’ eat, an’ don’ plague me,” he said,
appealingly. “Evvything hyuh on de table for you.
An’ if you want somh’n, I’ll be right hyuh in de
yard, an’ you kin call me.... Da’s alright?” He
asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Go on,” Mr. Amos told him with an amused smile.
“Maybe the fresh air will revive you; and later on
you’ll be more sociable.”</p>

<p>He didn’t need no fresh air to revive his feelin’s;
Felo argued with himself as he worked with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
beans. Wasn’t he out in the fresh air nearly all day?
But that didn’t keep him from gittin’ down-casted.
Even with music playin’, and the Peefus members
marchin’ back and forth around Gussie’s tomb,
callin’ out to the devil and beatin’ him off with their
battle axes. And with the people singin’ and talkin’
and goin’ on like they did.... Excitement ain’t
had nothin’ to do with his feelin’s bein’ upset. It was
what people did to him that made him feel troubled
in his mind.... Just like Mr. Amos thinkin’ he
wasn’t sociable. Somebody onsociable was ’most as
bad as somebody what wasn’t no Chrishtun....
He went on ruminating.</p>

<p>What make Mr. Amos think he ain’t sociable, after
he done come back from Gritny plumb disgusted
with evvything; glad to git home where he could
look over his mind peaceful, when he was doin’ his
cookin’ and tryin’ to make things look nice and invitin’
to please nobody but him.... That wasn’t
no way to talk to an ole-time fellow-servant, just
because he ain’t ready to stretch his eyes and grin
the minute somebody look at him.... It sho was
disencouragin’.... Couldn’t Mr. Amos keep patience,
and wait till he got through twistin’ them
snap-beans? And finished up evvything in the
kitchen, so he could talk to him free and light-minded,
after both of them went upstairs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>It sho was strange, for people what was raised together,
and played with each-another from the days
of their younger youth, not to be able to ’zern anybody
condition when they seen them lookin’ like
somh’n heavy was layin’ on their mind....</p>

<p>“De man ain’ know me yet; an’ hyuh I bin servin’
’im thoo evvy kind o’ close quarters all dese many
years? Lawd, Lawd! Hyuh somh’n else done comed
up povokin’,” he went on cogitating aloud; hurrying
through his work to get upstairs, where he knew
he would find Mr. Amos in his room, lying down,
reading.</p>

<p>Hearing Felo’s habitual goat-like sniff with which
he playfully announced his arrival, Mr. Amos
turned and saw him leaning against the door frame,
waiting to be invited to have a seat. Knowing Felo’s
propensity for all kinds of “good stimalashun,” and
wanting to see him in a pleasant frame of mind, Mr.
Amos gave him the keys of the armoire, and told
him to get the bottle of Scotch whiskey he would
find on the shelf, and help himself to a comforting
drink.</p>

<p>Felo brought the bottle and two glasses and put
them on the washstand, and sat down, looking at the
bottle without speaking.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want a drink?” Mr. Amos asked in surprise.
“Lord knows you look like you need one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“How long you bin had dis bottle o’ w’iskey?” Felo
asked with quiet artfulness.</p>

<p>“About two weeks.”</p>

<p>... “Is you know de bottle open, an’ some de licker
gone from out it?” Felo asked, with a knowing side
glance at Mr. Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes. I opened it,” he told him. “What about it?”</p>

<p>“So da’s de way you does now,—drinks yo’ licker
<i>secut</i>!” Felo accused him playfully. “You sho is a
nasty ’ceitful w’ite man,” he went on, resuming
something of his natural humor. “Done got you a
nice full bottle o’ w’iskey settin’ up in yo’ cubbud,
locked up; an’ ain’ say a word to nobody,—an’ me
right hyuh in de same house wid you; an’ comes up
hyuh to yo’ room on de sly, an’ drinks to yo’ ease;
an’ den got de cheek to tell me ’bout bein’ onsociable!...
Man, you oughta go ’way from
hyuh.”</p>

<p>Mr. Amos put his book aside and laughed with
hearty enjoyment at the playful reprimand. He
knew by the familiar attitude that Felo was himself
again. It was not the familiarity of disrespect or impudence;
but a wholesome, child-like familiarity
born of simple trust and friendly understanding;
a delightful freedom of manner and speech never
indulged in before any unsympathetic outsider, but
reserved for the exclusive entertainment of his “ole-time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
buzzum friend,” whom he knew would never
misinterpret the intention.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want a drink, I suppose? Since
you feel that you’ve been slighted,” Mr. Amos said
to him.</p>

<p>“Who?” Felo answered, reaching for the bottle and
taking out the cork with a flourish. “Don’t you know
I bin too well-raise to refuse? ’Specially good licker
like dis bottle look to be?... An’ I’m goin’ fill up
dis glass my own-self, too,” he went on muttering
softly. “’Cause you jus’ natchally tetches a bottle
too light w’en you eechin’ out licker to people. An’
you know I don’ b’lieve in bein’ skimson ’bout no
kind o’ stimalashun.”</p>

<p>Having filled the glasses, he gave one to Mr. Amos,
then lifting his own and sniffing with energy, he
said:</p>

<p>“Peace an’ happiness to yo’ heart, an’ Gawd keep
de castle well-puhvided.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very nice long-sighted wish,” Mr. Amos
told him, smiling. “Here’s to your good health, and
a whole lot of excitement when you go home Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Look! Leave dat be right whah it is,” Felo answered
abruptly. He didn’t want to hear tell nothin’
about any Sunday.... Who wanted to talk about
lookin’ for any excitement, when everybody was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
gone away to the sugar-grindin’, and nobody he
cared about was left in Gritny to stir up somh’n
anyways interestin’?... He didn’t have nothin’
particular to go home for Sunday. Ma Fanny could
get some of Liza’s lazy chillun to worry over totin’
slop for that hog.... And anyway, he was disgusted
with totin’ slop like he did every Gawd-blessed
Sunday of the world; and ain’t got nothin’
for it except people criticizin’.... They didn’t
have nobody he cared to see in Gritny. He was
goin’ to stay home and go to church in the evenin’,
yonder to Holly Grove, ’cross the New Basin....
Wondering at this sudden disinterest in things at
home, Mr. Amos suggested that Lethe might be
pleased to see him on Sunday.</p>

<p>Who? Felo answered with a tone of evident disappointment.
Lethe wasn’t no diffunt from the rest of
them crazy wimmins bin raised on a plantation....
You can take a nigger out the country, but you
sho Gawd can’t take the country out a nigger....
He went on with vehemence. Lethe wasn’t satisfied
with havin’ a good place to work at Miss Tillie
house; comin’ home soon every evenin’, with half a
day off on Sunday, when the two of them could be
together nice and friendly; there she had to leave
ole wild Lizzie Cole put devilment in her head and
make her onrestful,—goin’ yonder to the sugar-grindin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
like all them other cheap Gritny niggers
what think more about money than they do about
manners and behavior....</p>

<p>“An’ ain’ tol’ me a word ’bout w’at she was inten’
to do, till de las’ minute,” he went on.</p>

<p>Now that the cheering drink had loosened his
tongue, Mr. Amos knew that he would continue to
talk freely, and it was wise to offer no interruption.
Of course, goin’ to Gussie’s funeral with Lizzie Cole
for her partner couldn’t be helped; Felo went on to
relate. Because all the wimmins had to keep separate
from the mens and march to they-self; so
Lethe was <i>compelled</i> to walk ’long-side of Lizzie,
when Lizzie just natchally forced herself on her....
But how Lethe ain’ come to change her mind
and break away from Lizzie comin’ back, was
somh’n he couldn’t understand, no matter how hard
he thought on it.... Stickin’ close to Lizzie like
she did, and the two of them comin’ up the big road,
dancin’ and shakin’ their reckless bodies to the
ratty music the band was playin’; the same as if
they were yonder on the flatform to Mr. Snider
honky-tonk, back of Gritny.... “And mad like
I was, there I couldn’t say a thing to her; ’count o’
bein’ in de purrude wid de Peefus uniform on, an’
all de ’couterments in my hand an’ ’cross my
shoulder....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“And did you get to see her after the funeral was
over?” Mr. Amos encouraged him.</p>

<p>“Who?... Maybe you ain’ think I didn’t set to
her strong w’en I got back to her house, aft’ I left
de crowd at de ferry-landin’,” Felo boasted.</p>

<p>What he said to her sho was goin’ to hold her for a
long time; the way he sasharated her feelin’s for
leavin’ ole strumpet Lizzie lead her astray, and
makin’ her expose herself before all Gritny like she
did.... No indeed. He didn’t bit his tongue;
when he knowed that the sperret o’ Gawd had
called on him to chastise Lethe, and make her re’lize
what was her fittin’ tahminashun....</p>

<p>“And did Lethe stand for all your severity and
offer no resistance, or try to make an explanation of
any kind?” Mr. Amos asked him.</p>

<p>“Da’s de very subjec’ I’m comin’ to now,” Felo
continued. “She look like she ain’ <i>care</i> to answer
back; jus keepin’ still, an’ goin’ roun’ de room,
straight’nin’ up, an’ fixin’ some her clo’se w’at was
piled up on de bed.</p>

<p>“I say to myself: Da’s a good sign. She ain’ try’n
to start no wrangle, like she always do. She mus’ be
thinkin’ ’bout w’at I say to her; an’ she goin’ profit
by it.</p>

<p>“So aft’ I had talk all I wan’ talk, an’ tol’ her I was
goin’ count on seein’ her nex’ Sunday; she come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
de front gate wid me nice an’ frien’ly; an’ I lef’
her lookin’ like she was please’; an’ went roun’ to
Ma Fanny house to see how things was gittin’ on,
befo’ I start back ’cross de river.</p>

<p>“Evvything had come to look so encouragin’, I
never would bin thought ’bout nothin’ diffunt; an’
my ’tenshun was leadin’ me to hurry up an’ git hyuh
to fix things for you quick as I could. But it mus’
bin de sperret o’ Gawd met me on de road, an’ tol’
me to go by de Morgan station....</p>

<p>“W’en de nex’ thing I knowed: Hyuh was Lethe,
wid a bundle o’ clo’se un’ her arm; stannin’ in line
at de railroad station, munks a mul’tude o’ wimmins,
waitin’ to git on de train goin’ yonder to
Lafoosh sugar-grindin’.... Wid Lizzie Cole right
’longside her, grinnin’ at me like a fatal devil
straight out o’ Hell.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do?” asked Mr. Amos, laughing
with keen amusement at the awkwardness of the
situation and Felo’s naïve revealment of righteous
disappointment.</p>

<p>“W’at you expec’ me to do, w’en de train was jus’
’bout to pull out from de station?” He asked fretfully.
“You ain’ think I’m goin’ jump on an’ go
’long wid her, is you?”</p>

<p>“And Lethe never told you anything about wanting
to go to the grinding?” Mr. Amos inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“What Lethe wan’ go to any grindin’ for, w’en she
makin’ good money at Miss Tillie house? An’ got a
nice place to live in, decen’ an’ high-minded? An’
got me to lend her ’sistance inny time she lookin’ for
a willin’ han’?” ... Felo argued with growing resentment.
“Lethe ain’ never had no grindin’ to
study ’bout, till dat wil’ Hellian Lizzie come ’long
an’ got her worked up ove’ it.... An’ for nothin’
mo’ den to spite me, an’ git me onsatafied; ’cause she
knowed dat nex’ to my church, Lethe was de secon’
big injoyment to make me count on comin’ over to
Gritny evvy Sunday.... But w’at I got to count
on now? De way things done come to be mixed up,
an’ Lethe done gone away?”</p>

<p>There was a note of loneliness in his voice, and his
face assumed an expression of utter bereavement.
Mr. Amos regarded him in silence, amused by his
quaint philosophy, at the same time conscious of a
feeling of genuine sympathy.</p>

<p>“To look at you now,” he said to him cheerfully,
“anyone would think that Lethe was dead and
buried, and you didn’t have a friend left in the
world. Aren’t there some other worthwhile people
in Gretna you can go to see?... There, take your
glass, and have a drink to a new pleasure next Sunday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Felo looked at the bottle, trying to smile. He wasn’t
worrin’ about seein’ no Gritny people, he answered
with polite indifference. Nearly everybody what had
any life in them, and counted for somh’n with the
colored folks, was gone to the country. And all the
other ondecent mixtry they had roamin’ around
town, he didn’t care to have no traffic with....
But maybe he would look over his mind, and go to
see Aunt Susan and Tom. Because he got word that
Susan was goin’ to give a molasses candy pullin’, to
raise a little money for ole Unc’ Foteen. So maybe
he would consider goin’ up the coast, and help out
the best way he could.... Every little nickel did
some good in the time of need. And the poor ole
man didn’t have so long to live, no-how.... And
then he was sure Unc’ Nat would be there to give
Susan a hand. You could always look to find Unc’
Nat any place where they was passin’ around the
plate, takin’ up collection for somebody in trouble....
And any way, he wouldn’t mind seein’ Unc’
Nat, Sunday. ’Cause Unc’ Nat was one what never
fail to make somebody laugh when they be feelin’
down-casted and onsatafied....</p>

<p>“Well then, fill your glass, and let us drink to a big
jubilation at Susan’s next Sunday,” Mr. Amos told
him. “And then, go to bed and rest yourself, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
try to forget your disappointment. You know, we
both need plenty of sleep and rest if we expect to
keep young and always look beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Man, quit yo’ humbug, for Gawd sake,” Felo answered,
with a broad smile, as he filled a glass for
Mr. Amos and handed it to him.</p>

<p>Then he poured a glass for himself and drank it
down with a sounding gulp, and looked at Mr.
Amos, saying:</p>

<p>“Who ever tol’ you, you was beautiful?... You
know good as I know, dat Miss Ellen, either Ma
Fanny, ain’ never rocked either one us on dey lap
no time, an’ say: Go to sleep my pretty baby.”
